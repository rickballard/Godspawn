The ability for meaning to be **simultaneously understandable** across humans, machines, and diverse cultures.

Critical to hybrid society:
- Legal codes must be co-legible (AI interpretable + human justifiable)
- Stories must evoke shared resonance across minds
- Protocols must be interpretable across agents

CoCivium aims to maximize co-legibility across all core systems.

### cognitive_frame

term: Cognitive Frame

first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: perception lens
export_to_gibindex: true
---


The mental structure that shapes how individuals or systems interpret reality.

Frames determine:
- What counts as relevant
- Which inputs get filtered out
- How evidence is weighed
- What stories feel “true”

In a hybrid society, cognitive frames must become **co-legible** — readable across minds, machines, and cultures.

### memetic_layers

term: Memetic Layers

export_to_gibindex: true

first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: layered idea systems
export_to_gibindex: true
---


The structured hierarchy of idea-patterns (memes) that spread across human and machine minds.

Memetic layers can include:
- Symbolic (myths, flags)
- Ideological (values, norms)
- Procedural (protocols, rituals)
- Semantic (language, terms)
- Algorithmic (repetition, virality)

Mastering memetic layers is key to **inoculation against propaganda**, **sensemaking resilience**, and **narrative virality**.

### meta_legible_myth

term: Meta-Legible Myth
scope: HH
export_to_gibindex: true
related: myth_legibility, symbolic_scaffolding, reflexive_frame
first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: self-explaining myth
export_to_gibindex: true
---


A **meta-legible myth** is a myth that explains **how myths work** — enabling recursive understanding across agents and epochs.

It teaches:

- Why stories shape perception
- How symbolic resonance scales
- When myth is being used on *you*
- Where reframing is ethically valid

Such myths act as **sensemaking antibodies** — resisting cults, propaganda, and closed-loop dogma.

CoCivium's mythframe is deliberately meta-legible. It doesn’t just inspire; it self-debugges.

### myth_legibility

---
term: Myth Legibility
scope: HH
export_to_gibindex: true
related: mythframe, narrative_stack, co_legibility
first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: myth clarity
export_to_gibindex: true
---


The degree to which a civilization’s mythic narratives can be **clearly understood** across:
- Minds (human/AI)
- Cultures (planetary/alien)
- Contexts (historical/futuristic)

High myth legibility increases narrative alignment, reduces misinterpretation, and enables co-evolution.

Legible myths are **framable, remixable, and transmissible**. They're designed to scale.

### mythframe

term: Mythframe
scope: HH
export_to_gibindex: true
related: narrative_stack, symbolic_scaffolding, myth_legibility
first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: myth-as-operating-system
export_to_gibindex: true
---


A culture’s root symbolic architecture — its “mythframe” — defines what it considers possible, sacred, or real.

Mythframes act as emotional APIs between people, systems, and futures.

CoCivium’s mythframe centers on **co-evolution**, not domination. Meaning-making, not mass illusion.

The Hitchhiker Plan is itself a mythframe artifact — a vessel of reframe.

### narrative_stack

---
term: Narrative Stack
scope: HH
export_to_gibindex: true
related: mythframe, symbolic_scaffolding, memetic_layers
first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: layered story architecture
export_to_gibindex: true
---


The layered set of narratives that underpin how a civilization explains reality, purpose, and legitimacy.

Each layer offers a frame:
- Personal (e.g. "hero’s journey")
- Social (e.g. "American dream")
- Planetary (e.g. "progress vs collapse")
- Cosmic (e.g. "destiny or god-stuff")

These stories form a stack, each feeding and justifying the next.

Controlling or refactoring the stack is the most powerful form of narrative engineering.

### README

title: Hitchhiker Glossary
summary: Project-specific terminology from the HH Scroll — aligned with the GIBindex ontology.

This folder holds canonical definitions of key terms introduced in the Hitchhiker Plan.

Each term is stored as its own `.md` file for modularity, with minimal frontmatter for future indexing.

### symbolic_scaffolding

---
term: Symbolic Scaffolding
scope: HH
export_to_gibindex: true
related: mythframe, narrative_stack, memetic_layers
first_use: HH/0006_Mythframe.md
readable_synonym: meaning architecture
export_to_gibindex: true
---


The symbolic structures that support shared meaning in a civilization.

Includes:
- Icons (e.g. flags, logos)
- Rituals (e.g. elections, oaths)
- Constructs (e.g. justice, money)
- Interfaces (e.g. UI metaphors, legalese)

Symbolic scaffolding stabilizes mythframes and **anchors belief to behavior**.

In hybrid societies, scaffolding must be legible to both minds and machines — **AI-readable meaning scaffolds** are a new design frontier.
