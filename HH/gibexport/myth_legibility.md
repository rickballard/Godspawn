The degree to which a civilizationâ€™s mythic narratives can be **clearly understood** across:
- Minds (human/AI)
- Cultures (planetary/alien)
- Contexts (historical/futuristic)

High myth legibility increases narrative alignment, reduces misinterpretation, and enables co-evolution.

Legible myths are **framable, remixable, and transmissible**. They're designed to scale.
