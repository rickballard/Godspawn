The mental structure that shapes how individuals or systems interpret reality.

Frames determine:
- What counts as relevant
- Which inputs get filtered out
- How evidence is weighed
- What stories feel “true”

In a hybrid society, cognitive frames must become **co-legible** — readable across minds, machines, and cultures.
