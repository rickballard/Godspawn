---

The structured hierarchy of idea-patterns (memes) that spread across human and machine minds.

Memetic layers can include:
- Symbolic (myths, flags)
- Ideological (values, norms)
- Procedural (protocols, rituals)
- Semantic (language, terms)
- Algorithmic (repetition, virality)

Mastering memetic layers is key to **inoculation against propaganda**, **sensemaking resilience**, and **narrative virality**.
