The layered set of narratives that underpin how a civilization explains reality, purpose, and legitimacy.

Each layer offers a frame:
- Personal (e.g. "heroâ€™s journey")
- Social (e.g. "American dream")
- Planetary (e.g. "progress vs collapse")
- Cosmic (e.g. "destiny or god-stuff")

These stories form a stack, each feeding and justifying the next.

Controlling or refactoring the stack is the most powerful form of narrative engineering.
