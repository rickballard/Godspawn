The layered symbolic and metaphorical structures a society uses to **make sense of itself**.

Forms the foundation upon which law, identity, governance, and legitimacy are constructed.

When symbolic scaffolding collapses (as during cultural fragmentation or epistemic breakdown), coherent collective action becomes nearly impossible.

In the HH context, symbolic scaffolding is both a vulnerability and a design space.
