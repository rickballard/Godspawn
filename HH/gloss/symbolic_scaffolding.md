The symbolic structures that support shared meaning in a civilization.

Includes:
- Icons (e.g. flags, logos)
- Rituals (e.g. elections, oaths)
- Constructs (e.g. justice, money)
- Interfaces (e.g. UI metaphors, legalese)

Symbolic scaffolding stabilizes mythframes and **anchors belief to behavior**.

In hybrid societies, scaffolding must be legible to both minds and machines â€” **AI-readable meaning scaffolds** are a new design frontier.
