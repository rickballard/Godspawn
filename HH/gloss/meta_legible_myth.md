A **meta-legible myth** is a myth that explains **how myths work** — enabling recursive understanding across agents and epochs.

It teaches:

- Why stories shape perception
- How symbolic resonance scales
- When myth is being used on *you*
- Where reframing is ethically valid

Such myths act as **sensemaking antibodies** — resisting cults, propaganda, and closed-loop dogma.

CoCivium's mythframe is deliberately meta-legible. It doesn’t just inspire; it self-debugges.
