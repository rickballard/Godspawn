## 🛠️ 0004: The Plan

This is the part where we’d normally show you a pyramid.

Or a startup org chart.  
Or a systems map so tangled it looks like a subway line melted through a concept art gallery.

But that’s not how this works.

Because the Hitchhiker Plan doesn’t *scale up* in the old way. It *braids in*.

This is not a top-down manifesto.  
It’s a recursive pattern. A feedback braid.  
Designed to stabilize across six axes:

- **Myth**: shared narratives and symbolic architectures  
- **Law**: protocols for consent, risk, and co-governance  
- **Tech**: scalable systems and sensemaking stacks  
- **Planet**: planetary needs, climate, biosphere interlocks  
- **You**: subjective sovereignty and psychotechnics  
- **AI**: the co-agent, the challenger, the mirror

Each of these is not a silo.  
They interweave — like threads in a cognition rope.

This isn’t a puzzle you solve linearly.  
It’s a braid you step into.

And from inside the braid, you help weave what comes next.
