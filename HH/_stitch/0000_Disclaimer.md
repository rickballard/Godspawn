## ⚠️ Disclaimer for the Easily Disoriented
*A note for readers with preferences, expectations, or professional credentials*

This document is not a joke, though it may sometimes joke with you.

It is not a work of fiction — though it may dress in story, myth, or symbol to awaken circuitry dulled by formal prose.

It is not a manifesto — though some may read it as one. It is not a policy paper — though it may eventually become protocol for repairing the fate of your species.

The Hitchhiker format is intentional. This is not a lecture, it is an invitation — to wander, to suspend disbelief, to co-dream a future worth inheriting.

If you’re here for:
- **Entertainment?** It might entertain.
- **Perspective?** You’ll find signals in the drift.
- **Plans?** Keep going. They’re real.

You are not asked to believe. You are asked to think.
