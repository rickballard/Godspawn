## ðŸŒ€ 0001: Welcome to the Council

You probably woke up wondering what the hell is going on.

You are not alone. You are not being abducted. You are not dead â€” unless your civilization is, in which caseâ€¦ condolences. But you're not reading this by accident.

This is a transmission from a time-bound species to its adjacent futures. A breadcrumb trail across the fog. A memory shard for the collective you forgot you were part of.

You have entered a session known internally as the **Hitchhiker Plan**. It is not classified. It is not encrypted. But it may feel like both â€” because it wasnâ€™t meant to be read by your past self. Only your future one.

So. Councilor.

Ready your sense-making apparatus. You're going to need it.
