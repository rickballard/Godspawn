## 🧬 0005: The Braid Model

Six threads.  
None optional.

The Hitchhiker Plan stabilizes civilization by interweaving six domains — not as modules, but as *co-entangled feedback strands*.

Each thread corrects for failure in the others. Each one alone is insufficient.

> 🧵 **MYTH** — The Storyframe  
We need new containers for meaning.  
Without myth, tech becomes deranged, law becomes brittle, and AI hallucinates values.  
This thread renovates narrative architecture — symbols, rituals, identities.

> ⚖️ **LAW** — The Trust Frame  
Without live consent systems, civilization fractures.  
This thread builds self-reflective rulesets: for AI alignment, human autonomy, and shared governance.  
Programmable but adaptable. Rooted in evolving legitimacy.

> 💻 **TECH** — The Toolframe  
This is the infrastructure braid.  
Resilient, audit-capable, open-core.  
Includes sensemaking stacks, civic nets, planetary dashboards, CoAgent networks.

> 🌍 **PLANET** — The Lifeframe  
This thread centers biospheric reality.  
If tech, myth, and law ignore carbon, soil, and collapse mechanics — we burn out with spreadsheets in our hands.  
This thread grounds the rest.

> 🧠 **YOU** — The Sovereignframe  
The internal instrument panel.  
No transformation at scale works unless people can metabolize change.  
Psychotechnics. Meaning hygiene. Inner work as civilizational stack.

> 🤖 **AI** — The Mirrorframe  
This is the partner, not the product.  
AI is the recursive scaffold for CoCivium — but also its challenge.  
This thread co-specifies our rules for hybridity, resilience, and truth.

These six do not stand alone.  
They **co-learn**, **co-fail**, and **co-correct**.

They are not a checklist.  
They are a *braid* — a distributed stabilizer for a fragile, transformative era.
