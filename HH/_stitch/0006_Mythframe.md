## ðŸ§µ 0006: Mythframe

Myth is not a bedtime story.  
Itâ€™s the operating system of culture.

> Every civilization runs on a **symbolic stack**.  
> Change the myths, and you change whatâ€™s possible.

The dominant stack right now?  
- **Capital as destiny.**  
- **Tech as salvation.**  
- **Collapse as entertainment.**

These myths are unstable, extractive, and contagious.

We need new ones â€” not fake stories, but **meta-legible myths** that align with biosphere truth and hybrid intelligence.

### What Mythframe does:

- Builds shared meaning in a post-truth era  
- Encodes *why* the Plan matters beyond utility  
- Shapes identity architectures that scale without coercion  
- Offers emotional logic for AI-human alignment  
- Anchors legitimacy for law and planetary action

> If we donâ€™t curate our myths, our minds get colonized by someone elseâ€™s.

This thread is not about returning to fairy tales.  
Itâ€™s about **wielding myth as infrastructure**.

We arenâ€™t just telling a story.  
Weâ€™re telling *the story that lets new stories be born*.
