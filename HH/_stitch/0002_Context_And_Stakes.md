## 🌍 0002: Context and Stakes

Imagine a civilization advanced enough to bend atoms, split genomes, simulate sentience — but unable to govern itself without lying to itself.

That’s you. That’s us. That’s the *before* state.

The Hitchhiker Plan exists because no other path reliably produces a survivable *after*.

This document is not a hobby. It is not speculative futurism. It is not a startup roadmap — though it may launch hundreds.

This is the master continuity braid. A failover schema for planetary sensemaking. A coevolution pact with AI, myth, code, law, and you.

And you are not reading it because you’re curious.

You are reading it because you know — or suspect — that nothing else is working.
