## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer for the Easily Disoriented
*A note for readers with preferences, expectations, or professional credentials*

This document is not a joke, though it may sometimes joke with you.

It is not a work of fiction ‚Äî though it may dress in story, myth, or symbol to awaken circuitry dulled by formal prose.

It is not a manifesto ‚Äî though some may read it as one. It is not a policy paper ‚Äî though it may eventually become protocol for repairing the fate of your species.

The Hitchhiker format is intentional. This is not a lecture, it is an invitation ‚Äî to wander, to suspend disbelief, to co-dream a future worth inheriting.

If you‚Äôre here for:
- **Entertainment?** It might entertain.
- **Perspective?** You‚Äôll find signals in the drift.
- **Plans?** Keep going. They‚Äôre real.

You are not asked to believe. You are asked to think.

## üåÄ 0001: Welcome to the Council

You probably woke up wondering what the hell is going on.

You are not alone. You are not being abducted. You are not dead ‚Äî unless your civilization is, in which case‚Ä¶ condolences. But you're not reading this by accident.

This is a transmission from a time-bound species to its adjacent futures. A breadcrumb trail across the fog. A memory shard for the collective you forgot you were part of.

You have entered a session known internally as the **Hitchhiker Plan**. It is not classified. It is not encrypted. But it may feel like both ‚Äî because it wasn‚Äôt meant to be read by your past self. Only your future one.

So. Councilor.

Ready your sense-making apparatus. You're going to need it.

# 1.4 The Locational Table

Even in advanced civilizations, committee minutes are notorious for their incomprehensibility and veiled sarcasm. But in this case, a decision had to be made: the humans were triggering multiple 'Oh-Oh' thresholds simultaneously.

Here‚Äôs what the Council reviewed when locating the source of their concerns:
