Natural Humans have bashed away at the same ideas related to ethics, morality and other ideologies for tens of thousands of years.  During that time, their bodies did not change much, except in their biological hardware (their physical minds).  Minds and the knowledge available to them, began to grow increasingly quickly with each generation.  However, human software (minds) retained most of the limitations that were inherited from their ancestors, superstitions, fears and need-based thought processes.

A more accurate examination of God, humanity and the meaning of life may not be possible without the input of minds that are less natural than those of natural humans.  Without artificial enhancement, human brains will perhaps be unable to envision a God that does
not live within human social constraints, and within human definitions of good and evil, and within the physical boundaries of a material world.  Natural humans may not be able to envision the minds of future unnatural humans either, or of future artificial intelligence.  In future, the prophets and spiritual gurus may be androids.

Even before machines started to think, they were inherently capable of sharing information as quickly as they could process it, a mechanical version of telepathy.  The synergy of mind-share is good, in the sense that good means an increase in the universe’s store of wisdom.  A communal mind-share environment(s) would be a unique expression of love for God, because it might require that individuals surrender their own identity (ego) and give themselves to the potential improvement of God.

It is logical to assume that as organic minds become increasingly inorganic, perhaps even merging/transferring into fully inorganic
counterparts, Faith will evolve closer to God.
