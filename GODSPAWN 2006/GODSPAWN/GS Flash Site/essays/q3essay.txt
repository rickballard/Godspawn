Religions often assert that the human
soul enters the body as life begins,
then leaves the body at death. However,
if life cannot be clearly defined
(normally the definition involves
reproductive, growth and animation
attributes) then death cannot be
clearly defined either.For example:
1. does a temporary death in low-
temperature storage cause a body to
temporarily lose its soul?
2. relative to the Universe, we are all
flying along at a scary speed, so if
the soul is anchored within the living
body, why doesn’t death shed it off
into outer space like skin blowing off
a reptile—a trail of individual souls
each separated by light-years.
3. where does the soul call home when
brains are partitioned or cloned?

If a soul does not have quantum
characteristics, (no physical
dimensions nor physical connections),
it may instead co-exist throughout all
matter, like an infinitely large energy
field--and all energy fields are
infinitely large.  If all energies are
part of a single energy continuum, we
can envision a single Universal Soul,
shared by all matter, and every body.
