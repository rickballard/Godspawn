No, only my Religion offers the truth 	No religion can ever be accurate
It is OK if interpretations of my religion conflict, God wants us to think.

Natural Humans Must Leave Ancient Beliefs and Prepare for ReProgramming
"The most ridiculous concept ever perpetrated by H. Sapiens is that the Lord
God of Creation, Shaper and Ruler of the Universes, wants the saccharine
adoration of his creations, that he can be persuaded by their prayers, and
becomes petulant if he does not receive this flattery.  Yet this ridiculous
notion, without one real shred of evidence to bolster it, has gone on to found
one of the oldest, largest and least productive industries in history."
--Robert A Heinlein--

“A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as
revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence
and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.  Sooner or later, such a
religion will emerge.”
--Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot (1994)--

Eskimo: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?"
Priest: "No, not if you did not know."
Eskimo: "Then why did you tell me?"
--Annie Dillard in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek--
 
God is beyond religion, the search for truth is transcendental
(Tran*scend"ent, a.[L. transcendens, -entis, p. pr. of transcendere to
transcend: cf. F. transcendant, G. transcendent.].
Transcending, or reaching beyond, the limits of human knowledge;
applied to affirmations and speculations concerning what lies beyond
the reach of the human intellect.)

"The theory that you should always treat the religious convictions of other
people with respect finds no support in the Gospels."
--Arnold Lunn (1888-1974)--

Scripture is immutable, that is why it is so horribly out of date.
