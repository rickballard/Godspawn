Are Heaven & Hell Possible?
Conflict between cultures with different Faiths is more likely than between cultures that share the same faith.  It is difficult to watch one’s neighbors exercising their right to do things that--by your standards--are wrong, but when wrongs are perpetrated on a more
massive scale, one can feel even more obliged to interfere.  It is almost impossible to watch massive evils being preformed without feeling the need to interfere, especially if that culture believes that its actions are not evil.
 
Since the dawn of time, here on Earth, we have been bashing in each other’s craniums for the sake of God, as if God has given us instructions to make sure that our personal beliefs will always outlive us.  Faith is a powerful thing, and dying for what you believe
can feel like the single most noble aspiration available to us, but one must wonder if in death one is able to retain ones deadly convictions.

In death a mind may lose its independent identity and be reabsorbed back into God, regardless whether that mind was good or evil, so in the end if may not even matter.

Some Religions use Divine Judgment to explain how the soul of a dying human is directed toward Heaven or toward Hell, as if these are physical places like the top or bottom of a staircase.  Somewhere, a Divine Accountant, restrained by human social norms, quantifies a human’s whole life into a binary decision, a single credit or a single debit, assuming that the middle of the staircase is not littered with the results of Divine Indecision.  Even if an evil person is ultimately responsible for their own evil (a good person could be
brainwashed into an evil person), these Religions place too many simplistic restrictions upon God’s judgment.  It is more likely that
the description of Heaven and Hell was designed to herd simple minds, and interestingly, there are so many more descriptions of Hell than Heaven, as if Religions fed Hell’s threats more often than Heaven’s carrot of eternal comfort.

If science can create life from dead matter, as if life was merely a measure of matter’s quantum organization, can Hell be redefined
as entropy, the absence of organization?  This is not a definition that Religions can feed out so easily, since the occupants of an
entropy-Hell would lack the self-awareness to suffer for their sins.
