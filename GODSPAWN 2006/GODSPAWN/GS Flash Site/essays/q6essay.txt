Have you ever seen the way a flame plays with its background?  If you look past it, as if it wasn’t there, you will see what the flame’s heat does to the air.  Objects in the background appear to smear into each other, as if the heat is trying to steal away their identity.  This is not a pleasant sensation for most folks.  Without the ability to differentiate objects, without an ability to classify everything and give it a unique and special name, life for the average sane person would become rather challenging.

Our whole understanding of the universe depends upon identifying the things we see; yet heat is playing with everything, except perhaps the darkest corners of the universe.  The same goes for gravity, and perhaps for many other forces and energies that we have yet to identify.  What is certain is that by the time light from the sun bounces off an object and enters our eyes, the image has been distorted in many ways, and it is up to our minds to make sense out of it, stripping away any imperfections and making it appear to be a perfect image, even if perfection can only be our minds.

Energy touches everything, but then everything we see is actually made of energy.  Solid matter does not really exist as a substance; it only exists as a concept in our minds.  If a microscope could be made that was powerful enough to see into matter, it would show us something much like the universe, with the solid looking bits rather outnumbered by the empty looking bits.  In fact, each time we get better at “looking” into the solid looking bits, we find that they are far less solid than we like to imagine.  So far, science has found nothing that can be described as matter in the traditional sense.  When you get right into it, the universe and everything in it appears to be a jumble of energies, each merging into each other, like pieces of a cloud.

An energy field can be visualized by sprinkling iron filings onto a piece of paper, with a magnet underneath it.  This is an old science lesson, the filings all line up in neat rows like little ants biting each other’s butts, and these lines form arcs and loops
because the filings are being lined up by an invisible energy field: an electromagnetic energy field.  We have to give this field a unique and special name, otherwise the whole phenomenon would seem insane to our minds.  Yet, different kinds of energy are not
as discrete as we like to think.  By that I mean that energy is not a thing that can be quantified the way that three ounces of Scotch whisky can be.  Energy fields are infinitely large.

If you measure the strength of a magnet’s energy field, or the field around any other object for that matter, the field strength decays exponentially with distance.  Exponential decay?  Now, there’s a phrase designed to differentiate scientists from normal humans!  It just means that each step away from the source of the energy causes its energy field to be a fraction weaker.  When does fade away completely?  It doesn’t.  A fraction of something is always something, for example: half of a half of a half of a half…goes on and on for ever…and never gets to zero.

Thus, all energy fields are infinitely large, and everything is an energy field.  Do you see where I am going with this?

We give these fields different names so we don’t go nuts, but they are all still energy.  The universe is just energy, but because that energy is not evenly distributed, it shows up to us as cars, and flames, and oceans and anything we care to put a unique and special name to.  The following forms of energy can be attributed to live or dead objects: 
1. Potential energy, a function of their mass and distance from the earths center.
2. Heat energy, both thermal and radiant heat as a function of their temperature and specific heat factor.
3. Electromagnetic energy, flowing both into and out of an object
4. Nuclear decay energy related to E=Mcsquared energy
5. Energy related to their phase (solid, liquid or gas).
6. Energy is transferred into or out of any object that changes state.
7. Chemical potential energy, which is the energy that would be released if an object burns or otherwise changes chemical composition.

However, we only know about these energies because we can describe their behaviors and properties.  We are not naturally equipped to be able to “see” an energy field, and our attempts to represent them as images have been at best questionable.  In 1939, Semyon Kirlian discovered by accident that when an object on a photographic plate was subjected to a high-voltage electric field, an image was created on the plate.  The image looked like a colorful halo or coronal discharge.  Was this a physical manifestation of the spiritual aura or
"life force" that allegedly surrounds each living thing?

Kirlian photography and its many derivatives became a gateway to the paranormal world of auras, a multi billion dollar industry.  Actually, what is recorded is due to quite natural phenomena such as pressure, electrical grounding, humidity and temperature. Changes in moisture (which may reflect changes in emotions), barometric pressure, and voltage, among other things, will produce different 'auras'.  To date, Science has been unable to confirm that humans can directly “see” energy, despite the claims of many unusual humans who may or may not see energy “itself”.  It is perhaps more likely that whatever such individuals may see should not be described as
actual energy so much as a result of energy.
