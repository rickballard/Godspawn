Is God Evolving?

A paradox is created if a perfect God has a non-evolving mind; God cannot learn.

Organic brains have severe limitations in both complexity and processing speeds.

Organic intelligence might be an evolutionary stepping-stone toward artificial,
inorganic minds.

"...doing what little one can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as
respectable an object of life, as one can in any likelihood pursue"
--Charles Darwin--

"It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God,
but to create him."
--Arthur C. Clarke--

"The empires of the future are the empires of the mind."
--Winston Churchill--

We are all Godspawn, we all share the same evolutionary path, but we are also
just specks upon that path, somewhere between quantum particles and Godhead.
All specks serve the same God, we just serve It differently.

Perhaps, we can pray as much as we like, but if we are not learning or
teaching in the process, then we are wasting God’s time.

Pantheism, coined 1705 by J. Toland, is the doctrine that God is not a
personality, but that all laws, forces, manifestations, etc. of the universe
are God; the belief that God and the universe are one and the same; also used
occasionally to mean the worship, or toleration of worship, of all gods.

Deism The belief in God but the rejection of all religions.
  
Pantheism is the polar opposite of Deism. Where Deism stresses God's
transcendence, Pantheism stresses his immanence in the world.
