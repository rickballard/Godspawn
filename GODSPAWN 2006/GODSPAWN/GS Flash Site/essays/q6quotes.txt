"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone ever discovers exactly
what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and
be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another
theory which states that this has already happened."
--Douglas Adams, 1990--

“We are allowed to use Einstein's famous equation,
Energy = mass x  (speed of light)
to convert any scrap of matter into an equivalent quantity of energy.
So, at its essence, everything is made of energy, it is just that this
energy takes different forms in the physical world. In fact, because protons
are made of quarks and we know the mass of a quark, we discover that over
99 percent of the mass of the proton is locked up in the energy of the
field that holds the quarks together inside the proton! This energy of the
'gluon' field appears as real mass to the outside world. What this also
means is that 99 percent of your mass is in the form of field energy alone!”
--Dr. Sten Odenwald, 1997--

“When the electricity enters the living object, it produces an area of gas
ionization around the photographed object, assuming moisture is present on
the object. This moisture is transferred from the subject to the emulsion
surface of the photographic film and causes an alternation of the electric
charge pattern on the film. If a photograph is taken in a vacuum, where no
ionized gas is present, no Kirlian image appears. If the Kirlian image were
due to some paranormal fundamental living energy field, it should not
disappear in a simple vacuum”
