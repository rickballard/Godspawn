What Is Unnatural Evolution?
Apes have nearly identical DNA to Us.
A few genes make the difference between
an ape and a human.  Did humans split
from a common ancestor 6 million to
7 million years ago?
Traditional Western faiths such as
Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
contradict this theory.  As the
implications of genetic engineering
become increasingly apparent to the
general population, such faiths are
often displaced by more
scientifically justifiable holistic
spirituality.
Darwin’s theory of natural evolution
compromised the definition of
“human”, suggesting that Heaven
might not be exclusively for humans,
but it took time for the evidence
to grow in support of this theory,
until unnatural evolution by
genetic engineering.  In a world
where the more financially affluent
can became more intellectually
advanced, a new species of human
could begin to evolve.  Earth may
again, after two hundred thousand
years, accommodate more than one
species of human.  Science would
thus serve as a scalpel to
spiritually dissect human-kind, but
then science’s objective have always
been a unifying theory of the
Universe, not a unifying faith in God.
Will unnatural humans displace
natural humans, the way that humans
had displaced ape-men?  Will such
unnatural humans be allowed to mate
with natural humans, some Religions
do not accept that humans had souls
until God one must assume that some
Religions envision the first human
with a soul might have mated with
a soul-less human?  If homo-logue
society had a different
interpretation of good and evil,
could Heaven have different entry
requirements for different species?

If you adjust your nature are you
committing spiritual suicidal?
Should gene-upgrades be banned,
even to save lives?  If un-natural
humans can go to Heaven, then why
not aliens or mosquitoes?
