Mind Created By Science, Soul By Something Else. An adventure by A. Zoic... 	Blurred by the desertâ€™s heat haze, a man stood alone, watching the Ixis legion as its soldiers flashed their war-metal. He was wrapped in a sheet, which rustled in the wind like a white flag. From out of this sheet protruded a hairless head without eyebrows or eyelashes, and with skin as smooth and unblemished as the desert sky.
	The man was swaying from side to side, humming to himself, as one might if one were deeply troubled. His eyes looked ancient, but fiery like the sun, and his frown was that of a caretaker forbidden to care, a naturalist forbidden to interfere with Nature, a storyteller who could not speak.
