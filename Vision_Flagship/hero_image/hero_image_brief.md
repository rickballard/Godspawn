# Hero image brief — Mudfling to Lightring

Mood: dusk, calm, slightly luminous. Complex, not cluttered. Ten-foot legibility.

Scene: a grove with a soft ring of light on the ground (Lightring). Underfoot: mycelial threads. Overhead: branch-like networks. A winding trail with five gentle plateaus (EvoPath).

Objects:
- Sprites drifting nearby, clearly differentiated by color, size, and flight
- Leaf cards on the ground, words faintly in the veins
- A few Concept Nodes glowing in the branches
- Human figures relaxed, some laughing

Framing: left third hints Mudfling chaos; right two thirds show Lightring clarity.

Exports:
- web banner 2400×1350
- print A4
- SVG for crisp line work

Legibility: if you squint from ten feet you should still see ring, trail, and clusters.
