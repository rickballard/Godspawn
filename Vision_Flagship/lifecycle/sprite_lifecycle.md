# Sprite → Idea Card → Image → Concept Node

## Sprite
A bright impulse that would drift away if you did nothing.
- Color = kind (problem, insight, practice, hypothesis, story)
- Flutter = urgency (fast twitch vs slow float)
- Size = richness (how many links already latent)

## Idea Card
The leaf that catches the sprite.
- Human layer: title in the veins, tiny glyph, one or two lines, aura bar
- Machine layer: id, kind, waypoint, authors, timestamps, links, lineage, RepTag
- Place it on ground or branch; link cards by tap to form trails.

## Image (meme/diagram)
The portable shorthand for outreach and teaching.

## Concept Node
A cluster of linked cards that is strong enough to stand on its own.
- Visible in the branches with a soft reputation aura
- Carries lineage, evidence, and related practice cards

> Catch the spark. Give it a name. Let it grow roots and branches.

## Minimal schema note (for later)
We keep the JSON schema small: id, title, kind, waypoint, authors, timestamps, links, reptag, media. Enough for machines to help without scaring humans away.
