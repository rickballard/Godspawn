# Ethics and guardrails (illustrative scope)

This is an illustration, not a product claim. Treat it like a storyboard for good practice.

## People first
- Consent: participants know what is recorded and why.
- Visibility: human-readable first; machine-readable second.
- Choice: private notes stay private.

## Bias and fairness
- Counter-bias practice: steelman the other view; two-source check.
- Review: rotate who reads the “essence line” on cards to reduce voice dominance.

## Safety and context
- No dark patterns. No hidden scoring of people.
- Aura is about ideas (maturity, credibility), not about persons.

## Data hygiene
- Small by default: capture less, link more.
- Clear retention: compost old or deprecated ideas to the idea_dump.
