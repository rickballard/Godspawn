# The Meeting in the Grove

Two children walk into a grove at dusk. Their minds carry small AI companions that whisper context, not commands. They have come to practice the first step of EvoPath: self regulation.

The air is damp, the ground soft. Sprites drift like fireflies, each carrying a half formed thought. In a Mudfling those sprites would collide and splatter. Here, they pause, notice, and breathe.

"My pulse is racing," one says.
"Mine too," the other answers.
They smile, because noticing is already half the practice.

A ring of light appears on the ground. They step into it. Inside the Lightring their words slow. They speak in turns. Silence helps rather than hurts.

One child cups a drifting sprite. It unfolds into a glowing leaf. Words shimmer in its veins. In its core a deeper code hums, visible to their AI threads.

"See? The veins hold the phrase we can read. The DNA holds the schema the AIs can read. Turtles all the way down."

They place the leaf on the ground. It flattens into an Idea Card. The words remain, the aura settles, and the sprite becomes something they can navigate, revisit, and link. More leaves follow. Soon a small patch of ground is covered in glowing foliage, each card both story and code.

They test ideas. They test feelings. When frustration rises, they name it and let it pass. The ring holds them steady.

Above, Concept Nodes glow faintly in the branches. If they keep practicing, their small cards can grow into those sharable nodes. Strong enough to carry into wider circles.

The grove darkens. The ring brightens. They are calm. They are laughing. For once, the meeting worked.

# Non-Virtual Analogue: A Meeting at Work

Using pre AI technology, a business meeting would have modeled the previously described methodology with less inherent joy, and more paperwork, for example:

A few adults sit around a table. This would normally slide toward a Mudfling: laptops half open, side chatter, fast talk that nobody fully absorbs. Today they try a simpler pattern.

They begin with a pause. Phones face down. Eyes up. The pause is their Lightring.

An agenda item appears. Instead of a slide stack, one person captures it as a shared card: a single line of essence, plus a small aura bar that each person can nudge to reflect strength of feeling. Words carry the point. The aura carries the signal. Nobody has to fight for airtime.

A second card joins the first, then a third. Links appear: relates to, contrasts with, next move. It looks like tidy notes, but it feels like leaves arranging into a pattern.

Frustration spikes once. Someone names it. The pause returns. The circle holds. They laugh, then continue.

By the end they have five cards, linked and ranked, with clear next steps. The meeting ends early. People leave with energy, not drain. From Mudfling to Lightring.
