# Vision Flagship Session Plan — **EvoPath & Grove**

Purpose: illustrative flagship for CME thoughtshare; runs in parallel to HP.

## Deliverables
D1: The Meeting in the Grove (EvoPath Stage 1)  
D2: EvoPath model + diagram spec  
D3: Sprite → Idea Card → Node lifecycle (template + schema)  
D4: Hero image brief (grove + neuro/fungal network)  
D5: Vision paper outline (Thesis subpage)  
D6: Repo mapping + glossary (GIBindex seeds)  
D7: Godspawn hooks (P3 scene seeds, POV prompts)  
D8: HP interlocks (packaging/CoWrap)

## Audience Fit
Sponsor · Educator · Citizen — each should grok the hero in <5 min.

## Extra Inserts
- Rename “Bad Meeting” to **Calendar Tax** (baseline) → **Mapwalk** (CME outcome).
- Ethics note (privacy/bias/safety). Metrics: comprehension/recall/share intent.
