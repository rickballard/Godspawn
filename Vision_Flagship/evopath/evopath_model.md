# EvoPath â€” the trail through the grove

EvoPath is five waypoints you can walk with or without a headset. Each waypoint has a plain outcome, two or three practices, and a tiny metric you can imagine.

## 1) Self regulation
**Outcome**: you can notice and shift your internal state within a minute.  
**Practices**: label the pulse, 3 breaths, 10-second pause before reply.  
**Tiny metric**: time-to-calm (avg seconds to drop from red to amber).

## 2) Social fluency
**Outcome**: you read the room and speak clearly without heat.  
**Practices**: reflect back, one-breath turns, ask-before-argue.  
**Tiny metric**: ratio of interruptions to completed turns.

## 3) Knowledge navigation
**Outcome**: you spot bias and see system edges; you co-learn with AI.  
**Practices**: steelman the other view, two-source check, map three causes.  
**Tiny metric**: number of distinct sources referenced per decision.

## 4) Collective action
**Outcome**: disagreements are mapped; overlaps are found; next steps are small and owned.  
**Practices**: card linking (relates/contrasts), choose smallest next move, owner + time.  
**Tiny metric**: percent of cards with an assigned next move and owner.

## 5) Congruence
**Outcome**: personal, social, and civic layers line up enough to hold.  
**Practices**: check alignment (self/team/community), name tradeoffs, close the loop.  
**Tiny metric**: rework rate (actions done without reopening the conflict).

> Walk the five. Repeat. The trail gets easier, the map gets richer.
