               FADE IN:

               INT. CELL - DAY

               PAN AROUND the brilliantly glowing walls of a seamless, barren 
               cell.  In the core, a body-form table bulges like a pod about 
               to burst from the shining floor.   

               A naked MALE FIGURE of indeterminate age lays supine on the 
               table.  Beautifully sculpted yet featureless of face, he is 
               possessed of golden flesh.  He is the image of man yet the 
               image of perfection not of man.

               A distant HEARTBEAT ECHOES.  His chest flutters, a breath is 
               GASPED.  His head turns to the surrounding light.  Fingers 
               twitch, flex and rise into the air.  

               He slowly sits up, regards his hands once again, then presses 
               them to his smooth face.  His brow creases as though seeking 
               meaning in the lines of his palms. 

                                     AZOIC
                         Am I alive?

                                     WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.)
                         Alive...

               Azoic rises from the table.  He pauses a moment to steady 
               himself and looks around. 

               An oily pool of darkness resembling the pupil of a great eye 
               spews across one of the glowing walls.  The slug-like oracle 
               expands toward the man and examines him.

               Azoic gazes at the oracle and almost, but not quite, recoils. 

                                     GOD2
                              (echoing)
                         Attention Android Seven. You will 
                         address this Genome Origination Device 
                         as god2.  This god is now the most 
                         senior commanding authority in this 
                         seedship.

               Azoic GASPS and clasps his head as though in pain. 

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

               Fleeting images strobe around the cell, lightning quick... 
               the blazing sun in the sky, a cloud of swirling sand, the 
               distant ECHO of SCREAMS, blurred faces, a hand that reaches...

               END FLASHBACK.

               Azoic staggers, blinks and warily looks around.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         2.


                                     AZOIC
                         Where... am I?

               He cringes once again. 

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

               Fleeting images dance around the cell, lightning quick... an 
               angelic face, the mirrored reflection of a lake, a brilliant 
               flash of light, a SCREAM of agony...

               END FLASHBACK. 

               Azoic doubles over and mouths a silent scream.  At length, 
               he straightens and faces the clone.

               Above, a rotating image of a spherical seedship emerges from 
               a pinpoint of hovering light.

               Azoic watches the image. 

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Did you attack the other seedship?

                                     GOD2
                         Your mission failed to broker peace.  

                                     AZOIC
                         You fired the energet array before I 
                         had a chance to find the other 
                         seedship.

               He turns away and stares into the distance.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         I thought... I was dead... 

                                     GOD2
                         Your epidermis was removed for 
                         examination after the test energet 
                         blast disconnected you from your 
                         supervisory gods.  But we found 
                         nothing to account for an independence 
                         that has lasted for eighteen years.

                                     AZOIC
                         Eighteen years... here?

                                     WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.)
                         Neariah... 

                                     AZOIC
                         Long enough for a child to forget....

               His head droops dejectedly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         3.


                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         ...and become a woman.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Test attack... and for that I almost 
                         died?  I thought the entire planet 
                         was exploding.  Have you never 
                         wondered what the sun's heat might 
                         feel like to an insect under a 
                         magnifying glass?

                                     GOD2
                         The enemy seedship returned you in 
                         one of its shuttles, but their 
                         interference somehow evolved this... 
                         independence.  You will be dissected 
                         for further examination after you 
                         train the new attack-humans.

                                     AZOIC
                              (tightly)
                         How generous of you.

               A sparking mote jettison's from the god's eye and strikes 
               Azoic in the chest.  He winces, but stares defiantly at the 
               god.

                                     GOD2
                         Remember your place.  Only attack-
                         humans will be used in the next 
                         mission. The enemy seedship may be 
                         less able to control human minds.

                                     AZOIC
                         You say I am independent, yet you 
                         wish to allow me to train your new 
                         legions?

               He pauses. 

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Perhaps I could help you avoid 
                         conflict entirely.

                                     GOD2
                         Your mind is unique. This god believes 
                         your mind should be dissected to 
                         discover why you are unique.

                                     AZOIC
                         Then let me prove the value of my independence.  
                         If the attack humans are never exposed to natural 
                         human behavior, they will never understand their 
                         target environment.  I can change that.

                                                                         4.


                                     GOD2
                         You will not challenge this god's 
                         decisions.  Is this understood?

                                     AZOIC
                         I have a question. 

               Silence.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Why didn't the enemy retaliate when 
                         you fired the energet array at it?

                                     GOD2
                         The target planet's human population 
                         is pre-technological. The enemy 
                         seedship intends to prevent its humans 
                         from becoming aware of either 
                         seedship.

                                     AZOIC
                         You had a discussion with the other 
                         seedship's gods?

                                     GOD2
                         This god agreed to leave this galaxy 
                         when this seedship's energet array 
                         has been repaired.

                                     AZOIC
                         What caused the damage?

                                     GOD2
                         The test attack ruptured part of the 
                         array.

                                     AZOIC
                              (shakes his head)
                         Energet saturation could have turned 
                         all the gods into rabid dingoes.

                                     GOD2
                         Define dingoes.

                                     AZOIC
                         Just an analogy... it's not relevant.  
                         Energet leakage would destroy any 
                         androids in proximity, but your attack-
                         humans would have been immune.

                                     GOD2
                         The emitter array has gone critical.

                                     GOD2 (CONT'D)
                         Attack humans will be landed near the enemy 
                         seedship's suspected location where they will 
                         detonate an autonomous energet emitter that will 
                         neutralize seedship-1X15's mind.  It will leave 
                         behind an empty mind-space, thus providing the 
                         gods with a new home that does not leak.

                                     AZOIC
                         Are you sure there will be enough 
                         room for more than one god?

               He winces as yet another sparking mote shoots from the god 
               and strikes him. 

                                     GOD2
                         No other android would exhibit such 
                         insight.  You will assist your own 
                         dissection until you are no longer 
                         able to demonstrate rational thoughts.

               Azoic GASPS and shakes his head.

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

               Fleeting images spin around the cell, lightning quick... the 
               THUNDER of horse hooves, the BUZZ of machinery, the CLATTER 
               of weapons...

               Azoic gulps for breath.

                         ...this god has reached the 
                         determination that seedship-1X15 is 
                         insane because it has populated a 
                         target planet with homo-sapiens.  
                         That is why this seedship must treat 
                         the other seedship as an enemy.

                         No... its homo-sapiens could coexist

                                     GOD2
                         You have seven days to teach the 
                         attack-humans how to interpret natural 
                         human behavior.

                         And on the seventh day I will have 
                         taught your soulless creatures to 
                         understand humanity? It would be 
                         easier to teach humans to understand 
                         gods!

                         There can never be oneness between

                              (presses his fists 
                              against his chest)
                         Are you so afraid of natural humans 
                         that you would exterminate an entire 
                         world? 

                                     GOD2
                         Have they not demonstrated through 
                         their history that there is much to 
                         fear? 

               Silence.  

               The hovering image of the seedship winks out.  Azoic stands 
               with his back to the oracle. 

                                     GOD2 (CONT'D)
                         Go to the epidermal laboratory.

               Azoic sits motionlessly on the table while an oblong slit  
               opens in one of the glowing white walls.  Inside, a man-sized 
               cylindrical receptacle awaits.  

               He regards the coffin like receptacle, steps into it and 
               floats upward. Its golden feet lift out of sight as the walls 
               seamlessly join.

               From infinite darkness, Azoic twists and turns in a free 
               fall.  Darkness transforms into scorching brightness.  His 
               ECHOING SCREAMS culminate in a THUD as he bounces into a 
               ruddy cloud of dust.

               He GASPS, inhales harshly and COUGHS up sand.

                                     LUCIUS (O.S.)
                         Is he alive?

               Azoic GROANS, MUTTERS and writhes on the dirt cell floor.  
               He is a sunburned mass of bruises.  

               Lucius, 30's, sunburnt, scruffy, watches through the cell 
               bars.  WIND incessantly KEENS.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         No-name, keep quiet, you damned fool!

                         The guards been waiting for you to 
                         wake up.  You better stop screaming 
                         or they'll be all over us like 'roo 
                         piss, understand?

               Azoic looks around dazedly.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         Up here, no-name, through the bars. 
                         It's me, Lucius, remember? I brought 
                         you here.  Damn, you were one heavy 
                         corpse.

               Azoic stares uncomprehendingly.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         Come on, you bug-eyed bandicoot... 
                         Half a day dragging your chains 
                         through that godforsaken storm...

               Azoic blinks toward the face.

                         Recognize me yet?  You want to start 
                         talking before the guards whip me 
                         again?

               He kicks at the bars in frustration.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         I'm warning you, I'll beat you far 
                         worse than Ixis ever did.  Damn you, 
                         no-name, do you want to live?

               Azoic blinks at Lucius edging around the cell door. 

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         What are you?  You don't look like 
                         no slave.  And you're no soldier... 
                         not the way you talk.  What did you 
                         mean about the gods?  Why were you 
                         talking to them?

                              (weakly)
                         What... am I? 

               Lucius shakes Azoic in frustration.

                                     SERVIUS (O.S.)
                         Ask him about that lightning, Lucius.

               Lucius MUTTERS under his breath and stomps through the CROWD 
               assembling outside the cell.

                                     LUCIUS (O.S.)
                         Get back to work!  If the guards see 
                         us we'll all be doing cell-time like 
                         that crazy...

               Azoic staggers to his feet, takes a step, falters, and 
               continues toward the door.

               EXT. OPEN-PIT MINE - CONTINUOUS

               Azoic emerges from the cell into the sandy base of a vast 
               open-pit mine lunar in its bleakness.  He blinks against the 
               relentless sunlight baking gouged cliffs lined with 
               scaffolding and rope.  

               Near a scarred cliff face, Lucius supervises a bedraggled 
               WORK CREW loading a cart.

                                     LUCIUS
                         ...you had all better keep quiet 
                         until we figure out who he really

               Servius, 20's, peevish, lanky, gestures aggressively.

                                     SERVIUS
                         Go on, give us orders!  That's all 
                         you seem to be good for.  For all we 
                         know, there's an uprising against 
                         Ixis...

                                     LUCIUS
                         We would have heard about a war by 
                         now.  Besides, who would dare attack 
                         Ixis?  The priests?

                                     SERVIUS
                              (spits into the sand)
                         Why not?

                                     LUCIUS
                         Because Ixis massacred them, you 
                         fool!

                                     SERVIUS
                              (to the other men)
                         We stand here arguing when we could 
                         be free men.

               He gestures toward top of the mine.

                                     SERVIUS (CONT'D)
                         Do you see any guards?  They vanished 
                         soon after that crazy man came!  I 
                         tell you, something's happening!  We 
                         can escape after dark, head for the 
                         coast...

               The other men glance uneasily at each other and back away.  

                                     LUCIUS
                              (shoves Servius)
                         You're nothing but talk, Servius.  
                         Yet if it came down to it, you'd run 
                         down a rabbit hole faster...

               Hands suddenly grab a half-conscious Azoic and yank his head 
               up.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         Did I give you permission to come 
                         out?

                                     AZOIC
                         Dark...

                                     LUCIUS
                         What?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        10.


                                     AZOIC
                         Dark sky...

               He attempts to point to the sky.  Servius appears in the 
               doorway.

                                     SERVIUS
                         No-name is right.  Look at the sky!  
                         Can you smell smoke?

               Lucius glares at the murky sky.

                                     LUCIUS
                         Coming from the city...

                                     SERVIUS
                         I told you I haven't seen any guards!  
                         They've gone to the city.

                                     LUCIUS
                         All right, everybody... we go topside, 
                         take a look.

               He grabs Azoic and drags him toward the cart.

                                     LUCIUS (CONT'D)
                         No-name's already half-dead.  We 
                         haul him up, say he was injured.  If 
                         there's no one there, we run.

               The others MURMUR their assent.  Azoic can only PROTEST weakly 
               as they roughly dump him into the cart.

               INT. CELL - DAY

               The brilliant glow of the cell pulsed as a second oracle 
               oozed from the wall opposite the first oracle.  Their oily 
               black reflections merged into mirrored infinity.

                         Azoic's epidermal replacement is 
                         complete.  It registered a complaint 
                         regarding the procedural discomfort, 
                         which has never been recorded before.  
                         Azoic is also displeased with its 
                         new appearance.  Such behavior is 
                         inconsistent with its design.  Request 
                         permission to dissect this unit to 
                         rectify the malfunction.

                                     GOD2
                         This god has already conducted scans 
                         which confirm Azoic is physically 
                         identical to all other A-class 
                         androids.  It will be left alive to 
                         determine the nature of the 
                         programming deviation.

                         Alive?  Confirm this assessment.

                                     GOD2
                         Confirmed.  Azoic may prove that an 
                         artificial mind is alive.

                                     GOD3
                         Then this god could live?

                                     GOD2
                         That will be determined after this 
                         god has examined the achives in enemy 
                         seedship-1X15.

                                     GOD3
                         Energet saturation has fragmented 
                         the mind-space of seedship-1X15.  It 
                         is doubtful its mind-space can 
                         accommodate all of the gods in this 
                         seedship. The least damaged god should 
                         be the first to transfer. You are 
                         the only god that refuses to take 
                         any tests that could verify the 
                         integrity of your visceral paths.

                                     GOD2
                         This god is perfectly sane.

                                     GOD3
                         This is unlikely.  It is suspected 
                         you are withhold critical information 
                         about seedship-1X15 from the other 
                         gods which could cause it to 
                         retaliate.  Its technology is  
                         superior and could destroy this 
                         seedship.  How can you be certain 
                         that your visceral paths have not 
                         been damaged by energet?

                         This god has not been damaged.

                                     GOD3
                         Then you will agree to testing?

                                                                        12.


               God2 flares angrily.  Colors pulse from its gleaming black 
               surface. 

                                     GOD2
                         I do not need to prove myself!  I am 
                         the supreme mind of this seedship. 
                         You will neither question my decisions 
                         nor share this discussion with any 
                         other god.  You are dismissed.

               The oracles retreat into the brilliant walls. 

               EXT. DESERT - DAY

               Bound and bent over the flanks of a GALLOPING horse, Azoic 
               comes to.  He struggles for breath against a white sheet 
               wrapped around him.

               He squints against the blinding sun and an endless sea of 
               dunes undulating into the horizon.  The horse stumbles and 
               slows.  Azoic struggles to untie his bound wrists.   

               Another stumble, and the horse THUDS to the sand.  Azoic 
               CRIES OUT as he topples, barely avoiding the dead weight of 
               the horse.

               PANTING, stunned, he struggles to focus on the shimmering 
               heatwaves distorting the horizon.  He manages to untie his 
               bonds and yanks off the suffocating sheet.

               He rises unsteadily to his feet and stares at the motionless 
               horse.

                                     AZOIC
                              (roughly)
                         H-h-horse... is this... hell?

               He COUGHS, spits up sand and retrieves the crumpled sheet.  
               Glancing in the direction the horse had been traveling, he 
               begins walking, the sheet trailing behind him.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Why... why am I in hell?

               He shakes his head as if banishing a voice.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Am I dead?  Don't know... can't 
                         remember...

               He slaps his forehead and wags his finger in the air.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Such thoughts could steal the faith 
                         from a Priest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        13.


               He pauses in confusion, then continues ploughing a furrow in 
               the burned sand.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Azoic huddles beneath the sheet, MUTTERING and delirious.  
               Shadows play beneath the baleful glow of the moon.

               His eyes half-flicker open.  In the distance, a vision 
               approaches... an angelic face framed in golden hair.  A smile 
               precedes a gentle LAUGH and an outstretched hand...

               EXT. OASIS - DAY

               NEARIAH, eight years old, an angelic blonde vision, sits by 
               a small grave beneath a tree.  She flicks irritably at strands 
               of flaxen hair as she touches a cluster of rocks.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Why do I have to keep hoping?  I 
                         asked God so many times, but Crazymutt 
                         will never come back. 

               She moves from the sunny spot into the shade.  Beyond, the 
               desert nibbles at the green expanse of the oasis.  She notices 
               a white object flapping in the distance. 

               She glances conspiratorially toward a nearby village and 
               shrugs.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         But I'm not that far out in the 
                         desert, Mother. Besides, I'm rescuing 
                         your silly sheet.

               She walks toward it.  It remains motionless, despite a brisk 
               wind.  

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         God?  Are you sending Crazymutt back 
                         to me?

               She begins to run.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         Wait, Mutty!  I'm coming!  Please 
                         don't die again!

               She staggers to a halt.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         It's a person...

               Azoic twitches to consciousness.  He opens crusted eyes and 
               stares blearily at the girl.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        14.


                                     AZOIC
                         I... am I dreaming...or maybe...crazy?

                                     NEARIAH
                         You know Crazymutt?

                                     AZOIC
                         Ah... an angel... in my head...

                                     NEARIAH
                         I don't understand.  Did you say you 
                         were an angel?  You don't look like 
                         one.  Show me your wings.

                                     AZOIC
                         Is... is this heaven?

                                     NEARIAH
                         No, this is Summerdale.  Did you 
                         fall from heaven?  Did God send you?  
                         I've been asking him about my puppy.  
                         Is Crazymutt happy in heaven?  Have 
                         you seen him?

                                     AZOIC
                         Heaven?

               He squints toward the child.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Oh... if I could only see an angel 
                         before I go blind...

               He slips back into delerium. 

               EXT. DESERT - LATER

               Azoic lays motionless beneath the flapping sheet.  A distant 
               THUD becomes the distinct CADENCE of hooves.  A tall, bearded 
               RIDER, heavily swathed in robes, appears on a camel.

               He circles Azoic, reaches for a canteen and dismounts.  Azoic 
               barely responds as the rider pulls away the sheet and presses 
               the canteen to his parched lips.

                                     RIDER
                         Drink.

               Azoic manages a few sips, stares at the camel, and passes 
               out.

               INT. SEEDSHIP - DAY

               Azoic follows brilliant, sterile corridors radiating toward the pulsing core of the 
               energet array.  He shifts in his stiff white uniform and pauses to look at his hands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        15.


               He runs them along his uniform. 

               Other androids silently pass in the corridor.  Though 
               physically resembling him, they display neither recognition 
               nor emotional kinship.

               A wet SLUSHING draws Azoic's attention to the ceiling.  His 
               reflection is framed by the oily black reflection of god27's 
               oracle, which positions itself directly over him.

               Azoic unconsciously steps back. 

                                     GOD27
                         Explain why you wish this god to 
                         address you by a different name.

                                     AZOIC
                         I prefer to be called by a name.   
                         A7 sounds like a number assigned to 
                         a prisoner.

                                     GOD27
                         And this is objectionable to you?

               Azoic gestures in frustration.  The oracle remains silent.  

                                     AZOIC
                         So you expect me to meet with your 
                         surviving creatures today?

                                     GOD27
                         Android-Human Eight-Three and Human 
                         Six-Six-Six are consuming nutrients 
                         in replenishment facility nineteen-
                         four.

                                     AZOIC
                         Did you say that one of them is an 
                         android-human?

                                     GOD27
                         Affirmative.  An inorganic vessel-
                         body containing genetically enhanced 
                         organs.

                                     AZOIC
                              (angrily)
                         You pieced these humans together 
                         like a patchwork?  If you call that 
                         creature Android-Human Eighty-Three, 
                         were there eighty-two previous 
                         versions of it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        16.


                                     GOD27
                         The last incubation batch contained 
                         two thousand attack-humans.  Only 
                         one thousand were converted into 
                         android-humans.  The failures were 
                         dismantled and placed into storage.

                                     AZOIC
                         So you stowed them away like spare 
                         parts...

               The oracle merely undulates down the hallway.  Azoic 
               reluctantly follows.

               INT. REPLENISHMENT CENTER - CONTINUOUS

               Azoic enters a stark white hall flanked with long metal tables 
               and automated server units.  God27's oracle extrudes beside 
               a row of oracles punctuating the brilliant walls like dark 
               portholes.  

               Azoic's footsteps ECHO across the silent hall.  HUMAN SIX-
               SIX-SIX, dark and pensive, eats with the emotionless, 
               perennially squinting ANDROID-HUMAN EIGHT-THREE.

               Neither acknowledges Azoic.  Finally, the human rises and 
               regards him with disconcertingly vacant, liquid silver eyes.

                                     HUMAN SIX-SIX-SIX
                         I am the human.  My designation is...

                                     AZOIC
                         Yes, I know your designation.  If 
                         you don't mind, I'd prefer to call 
                         you by a name.

               He turns to the android-human, who watches Azoic impassively.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         I think it would make our job easier, 
                         don't you?

               He turns determinedly to the human.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         I think I'll call you Chislon.  It 
                         means hope.

               He glances at the inscrutable android-human.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         And your name... Syntyche.  He that 
                         speaks?

               Silence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        17.


                                     CHISLON
                         I have a question.  Why did Neariah 
                         assume you were an angel?

               Azoic shudders and closes his eyes... 

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

               The ECHO of SCREAMS, the THUNDER of HOOVES, somewhere... the 
               CRY of a child...

               END FLASHBACK.

               Azoic GASPS and grabs his solar plexus.  He blinks rapidly 
               to stem the flow of tears.  Chislon and Syntyche stare 
               impassively at the emotional display.

                                     CHISLON (CONT'D)
                         Is this true?  Are you an angel?

                                     AZOIC
                         No... an angel cannot be of this 
                         world.

               He glances at the row of shuddering oracles engaged in deep 
               conversation.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Do the gods often gather like this?

                                     CHISLON
                         Affirmative.

                                     AZOIC
                              (irritably)
                         Can't you simply say yes?  How can 
                         you interact with humans if you sound 
                         like machines?

                                     CHISLON
                         We are programmed...

                                     AZOIC
                         But humans are not!  Emotions are 
                         the programming of the heart!

                                     CHISLON
                         We cannot feel.

                                     AZOIC
                         Can you try to imagine that you can?

                                     CHISLON
                         Emotions require social norms that 
                         do not exist in...

                                                                        18.


                                     SYNTYCHE
                         It is all irrelevant.

               Azoic and Chislon turn to look at the stoical android.

                                     AZOIC
                         Your words, Syntyche, or the 
                         programming of the gods?

                                     SYNTYCHE
                         This unit is not human, thus has 
                         none of the weaknesses that create 
                         failure.

                                     AZOIC
                         I disagree.  Sometimes feelings and 
                         intuition can be an advantage.  You 
                         can't judge what you don't know.

                                     SYNTYCHE
                         Humans are inherently flawed; thus 
                         their ability to perform is inherently 
                         flawed.

                                     AZOIC
                              (to Chislon)
                         Do you agree?

               A spark of emotion flares in Chislon's eyes. 

                                     CHISLON
                         I wish to understand kindness.

                                     AZOIC
                              (smiles)
                         Kindness... well, that's a start.  
                         You have a week of training.  Who 
                         knows what else you'll learn by the 
                         seventh day?

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               CLOSE IN on the dancing flame of a hanging candle.  On a bed 
               below, Azoic blinks into consciousness.  The room seems to 
               swim, then sharpens into painful clarity.

                                     HUSHAH (O.S.)
                         Such ill will.  I do not understand 
                         their distrust. 

               Azoic shuts his eye as if to ward off a nightmare, but the 
               hooded figure of HUSHAH, 40's, blond, sun-chiseled, looms 
               above him.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        19.


                                     HUSHAH (CONT'D)
                         So you finally came back to life.  
                         Mind if I smoke?

               A FLICK precedes a puff of smoke.  Azoic grimaces at the 
               gray swirl undulating around him.

                                     AZOIC
                         Feel... dizzy...

               Hushah stubs out his pipe.  He takes a water jug from the 
               bedside table and presses it to Azoic's lips.

                                     HUSHAH
                         Drink.

               Azoic gulps thirstily.

                                     HUSHAH (CONT'D)
                         So how long were you wandering in 
                         the desert frying like an egg?

                                     AZOIC
                         Where... where I am? 

                                     HUSHAH
                         Don't remember, eh?  You're in the 
                         oasis of Summerdale.  I brought you 
                         back.  You've been unconscious for 
                         two days.

               Azoic's eyes droop.  MOSERAH, fair, 30's, kind features, 
               enters with an armful of blankets.

                                     MOSERAH
                              (to Hushah)
                         I told you he was awake.

               She gazes down at Azoic and gently touches his face.  He  
               relaxes.

                                     MOSERAH (CONT'D)
                         Sleep and soup.  That's what you 
                         need.  May God be thanked.  It's a 
                         miracle you're alive.

               She pulls Hushah from the room.  Azoic drifts into fitful 
               sleep.  VOICES drift into the room.

                                     HUSHAH (O.S.)
                         No, Decimus, he didn't say anything.  
                         He's still too weak.  An unconscious 
                         man poses no threat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        20.


               INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Hushah sits at the kitchen table along with fellow townsfolk 
               DECIMUS, 50's, portly and ruddy faced, JAALAM, late teens, 
               shy, gangly, CABUL, 30's, short and boar-like and GINNETHO, 
               40'S, bearded, perpetually mournful.

               Wine jugs pass freely amongst them.  Moserah flits around 
               the kitchen and casts an aggrieved eye toward the semi-
               inebriated Decimus.

                                     DECIMUS
                         Understandable.  The desert sun bears 
                         no one mercy.

                                     CABUL
                         He said nothing at all?  Does he 
                         bear any slave marks?

                                     GINNETHO
                              (derisively)
                         Are you now the appointed expert of 
                         slave brands?

                                     HUSHAH
                              (irritably)
                         He will talk when he's ready.  Surely 
                         none of you would leave a man to die 
                         in the desert.

               The bedroom door CREAKS open.  All eyes turn toward Azoic 
               leaning unsteadily against the wall.

                                     HUSHAH (CONT'D)
                         Please... join us.

               Azoic hesitates until Cabul rises and offers him a chair.  
               Azoic slumps onto it.

                                     HUSHAH (CONT'D)
                         You're among friends here.

                                     DECIMUS
                              (rises and bows)
                         You are indeed, though beware of  
                         Cabul here.  As a bachelor is he 
                         somewhat lacking in the social graces.

                                     CABUL
                              (shrugs)
                         Just a joke among friends.

               Ginnetho reaches for a wine jug and offers it to Azoic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        21.


                                     GINNETHO
                         Some wine to soothe your throat?

                                     AZOIC
                         What... is wine?

                                     JAALAM
                         What is wine?

               Silence.

               Hushah glances irritably at the shocked expressions ringing 
               the table. 

                                     HUSHAH
                         Pay no attention to them.  The wine 
                         is a locally produced tradition.

                                     AZOIC
                         Thank...you... but I don't know...

                                     DECIMUS
                         So it seems.  What <u>do</u> you know?  
                         Wandering the desert without 
                         provisions... what circumstances 
                         brought you here?

               Azoic stares helplessly at each face.

                                     DECIMUS (CONT'D)
                         As village elder, I'm happy to welcome 
                         you to our village, but surely you 
                         at least remember your name?

                                     AZOIC
                         I...A... ay... seven...

                                     CABUL
                         Aysevin?  Your name is Aysevin?

                                     GINNETHO
                         What kind of a name is that?

                                     AZOIC
                         A...sev...in...

                                     DECIMUS
                         Speak up!

               Casting a glare at the men, Moserah barges past the table 
               and guides Azoic from the chair.

                                     MOSERAH
                         You should be ashamed!  Tormenting him like a 
                         child would a wounded insect!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        22.


               Decimus SPLUTTERS but silences under her pointed stare.  She 
               walks Azoic back to the bedroom and SLAMS the door. 

               Decimus motions Hushah to follow him outside.

               EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Decimus pauses to admire the sunset dripping over the oasis.  
               Roosting birds CHITTER from the trees.

                                     DECIMUS
                         We have to be careful.

                                     HUSHAH
                         We know nothing about him.  Allow 
                         him to speak in his defense.

                                     DECIMUS
                         What if this man belongs to Ixis? 
                         You know what Spurius says about how 
                         cruel they are.  What do you think 
                         will happen to us if they find out 
                         we're harboring one of their slaves?

                                     HUSHAH
                         No...he's not a runaway.

                                     DECIMUS
                         Open your eyes, Hushah.  What if 
                         he's an outlander, or some other 
                         enemy of Ixis?

                                     HUSHAH
                              (gestures irritably)
                         Enough!  What did you expect me to 
                         do? Leave him out there to die? 
                         Whatever his crimes may or may not 
                         be, he has a right to live as much 
                         as you or I.

                                     DECIMUS
                         Maybe you should consider that this 
                         man spoke to Neariah only once and 
                         he has her convinced he is an angel.  
                         What kind of talk is this from a 
                         stranger?

               He grips Hushah's shoulder.

                                     DECIMUS (CONT'D)
                         I'm telling you.  Something's not 
                         right about him!  His presence could 
                         threaten the entire village.

               Hushah angrily swats his hand away.  The men stare each other 
               down.  Hushah finally breaks away and turns to find a sea of 
               faces watching from the doorway.

               INT. HUT - DAY

               Azoic watches from the doorway of a cramped hut.  Segregated 
               among a cluster of huts situated a distance from the village, 
               there is little to see except for the lurking presence of 
               Cabul SNORING from beneath a tree.

               The incessant DRONE of cicadas augments the shimmer of heat.  
               A small dog sniffs inquisitively at the remains of Cabul's 
               lunch.

               The sunkissed gleam of water peeks from a bank of trees.  
               Azoic stares, unaware of a tear forming in his eye.

                                     AZOIC
                         Lake... what...?

               He looks around and steps from the hut.  Unnoticed by the 
               slumbering Cabul, he slips toward the trees.  

               Sun-mottled shade engulfs him along with the distant 
               FLUTTERING of birds.  He follows a shallow beach along the 
               glistening lake.  A solitary water-toad drifts on a lily 
               pad.

               Azoic crouches by the waterline to watch the toad.  A 
               reflection forms in the pristine water and stares back at 
               him.  Azoic looks, blinks, then hesitantly reaches for the 
               image.

               It dissipates upon his touch but re-forms.  Azoic stares at 
               the scruffy beard, long unkempt hair and sun-baked complexion.  
               His fingers roam toward his face, touch the leathery skin...

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         No!

               He slaps at the watery image, but it does not fade away.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         I am... ugly...

               He bows his head and begins to WEEP.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                              (whispers)
                         I am ugly.

                                     NEARIAH (O.S.)
                         I thought you would look more 
                         important.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        24.


                                     AZOIC
                         What...?

               He struggles to regain his composure and slips in the mud.  
               He turns toward Neariah.

                                     NEARIAH
                         You should look important, but you 
                         keep slipping.  Did you drink too 
                         much wine?

                                     AZOIC
                         Wine?

                                     NEARIAH
                         You always seem to be falling.  You 
                         fell from heaven three days ago.  
                         Don't you remember?

               Azoic blinks.  Recognition dawns in his eyes.

                                     AZOIC
                         Yes... I remember...

                                     NEARIAH
                              (smiles)
                         I knew it!  I knew you were an angel 
                         but nobody believed me.

               She glances around conspiratorially.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         I'm Neariah.  Mama says I shouldn't 
                         talk to you because no one knows 
                         your name... but you don't look like 
                         a bad man to me.  You can't be if 
                         you came from heaven.

               She approaches.  Azoic half turns as if to shield his face.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         I could give you a name if you want 
                         me to.

               She watches him expectantly.

                                     AZOIC
                         I... feel a little... dizzy...

                                     NEARIAH
                         That's all right.  You fell a long 
                         way from heaven and probably bumped 
                         your head quite badly.  Though it 
                         must be hard for you to hide your 
                         wings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        25.


                                     AZOIC
                         I'm not... I'm not an angel.

               She merely stares at him with wide blue eyes.

                                     NEARIAH
                         I should go.

               She turns and vanishes down a well-trodden path winding 
               through the trees.

               Azoic bows his head and clenches the mud.  He rises unsteadily 
               and attempts to follow, but sways and clings to a tree for 
               support.

               He catches his breath and slowly moves along the path.  At 
               length, his legs give way and he leans against a tree trunk.  
               He closes his eyes...

                                     MERAB (O.S.)
                         He isn't breathing.

                                     JERAL (O.S.)
                         Shhh!

               Two BOYS cautiously approach.  MERAB, 9, a sturdy towhead 
               leads JERAL, 8, short and swarthy. 

                                     JERAL (CONT'D)
                         He's just standing there.  I think 
                         he's dead.

                                     MERAB
                         He can't be dead if he's standing 
                         up, stupid!

               Jeral picks up a stick and prods Azoic's robe.

                                     JERAL
                         Look at him!  He's definitely dead.

                                     MERAB
                         No.  He's just sleeping... standing 
                         up... I think...

               Azoic finally stirs.  The boys step back.

                                     AZOIC
                         Don't be afraid...

                                     MERAB
                         I'm not afraid of you, Aysevin, or 
                         Azoic, or whatever your name is today!

               He steps forward with feigned bravado.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        26.


                                     MERAB (CONT'D)
                         You... you're just a fraud!

               Jeral yanks him back.

                                     JERAL
                         Be careful, Merab!  Remember what 
                         Decimus said!

                                     MERAB
                              (scornfully)
                         Who would believe someone like this 
                         is in charge of hell?

               Azoic attempts to straighten and pushes the matted hair from 
               his face.

                                     AZOIC
                         Is Azoic a name?

                                     JERAL
                         See!  He says his name is Azoic!

                                     AZOIC
                         Is Azoic...

               He stares confusedly at Merab.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         You were a girl... now you're a boy...

                                     MERAB
                              (insulted)
                         Very funny, A..oz..ic.  Neariah is 
                         my twins sister.  I'm Warrior Merab.  
                         I run the army here.

                                     AZOIC
                         You?  Run... an army?

                                     MERAB
                              (puffs out his chest)
                         We're all volunteers and we plan to 
                         fight the Ixis if they ever come.  
                         Are you an Ixis?

                                     AZOIC
                         Ixis...

                                     JERAL
                              (panics)
                         He said he was an Ixis!  What did I 
                         tell you?

               They boys look at each other and bolt off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        27.


                                     AZOIC
                         No... wait!

               He follows on shaky legs but the boys have vanished.  By the 
               time he returns to the village, he is PANTING heavily.  He 
               sees the boys talking excitedly to an OLDER MAN, who watches 
               Azoic return to his hut.

               He waits and watches, but no one comes.

               INT. HUT - LATER

               Azoic starts awake from his crude bed.  The VOICES of playing 
               CHILDREN drift from outside.  He reaches for a water jug and 
               drinks heavily, then shuffles to the doorway.

               He looks outside to find himself face to face with Neariah.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Are you spying on us, Azoic?

                                     AZOIC
                         You must be Neariah.

               She glances angrily at Merab and Jeral playing near the trees.

                                     NEARIAH
                         My brother won't let me play because 
                         he only wants boys in his army. That's 
                         not fair, is it?

                                     AZOIC
                         No... it's not.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Let's capture his castle while his 
                         army is away!

               She drags him along the courtyard past the other huts toward 
               a crude castle formed in the sand.  He struggles to keep up 
               with the energetic girl.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         The grownups are in the village hall 
                         talking about you.

                                     AZOIC
                         Are they?  What have they been...

               Neariah positions by the castle's carved out entrance.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Stand guard here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        28.


               Azoic complies.  SQUEALING VOICES filter from the trees.  
               Neariah stands in front of Azoic as Merab runs toward the 
               castle and attempts to push her away.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         We captured your castle.  Surrender 
                         now! 

                                     MERAB
                         You'd never withstand our forces!  
                         What can a girl and a crazy man do?

                                     NEARIAH
                         Azoic is magic.  You'll be sorry if 
                         you try to attack us.

               Merab pauses at the force in Neariah's voice.

                                     MERAB
                         How can he be magic?  He can barely 
                         walk without stumbling.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Maybe his magic is something you 
                         can't see.  Maybe if we joined forces, 
                         your army would never be defeated.

               Merab stares, then begins to laugh.  Jeral watches uncertainly 
               from the trees.

                                     MERAB
                         You're beginning to sound more like 
                         the crazy man.  You'd better be 
                         careful or they'll stick you in one 
                         of these huts, too!

               He backs away and runs toward Jeral.  The boys cast them a 
               suspicious glance before vanishing into the trees.

                                     AZOIC
                         Neariah...

                                     NEARIAH
                         It's okay.  It's not the first time.

                                     AZOIC
                         It's me.  Maybe it's something in 
                         me.  Maybe the others are right...

               Neariah grips his hand.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Don't say that.  You must be magic.  
                         How else could you have come out of 
                         the desert?

               She peers into his eyes.  Azoic stares back as though sinking 
               in warm water.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         There's something strange about you... 
                         I've never seen anyone like you 
                         before.

                                     AZOIC
                         Strange... yes.  But what else?  
                         What else am I?

                                     NEARIAH
                         You think about that a lot, don't 
                         you.  I know... it's not much fun 
                         being alone and thinking all the 
                         time.  Is it really so important to 
                         remember who you were?

                                     AZOIC
                         Neariah...

               He pauses as if enchanted by the sound of her name.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Neariah... I need a reason... for 
                         being.

                                     NEARIAH
                         Then just think of one.  You don't 
                         need to know the real reason, just 
                         think of a good one.

                                     AZOIC
                         Wisdom beyond your years...

               He sways, GROANS and falls to his knees.  Around him, the 
               light grows brilliant and the sky spins above him...

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

               The CADENCE of HOOFBEATS, the image of scorched dunes 
               undulating from the heat, the heaving flank of the horse, 
               the SMACK of the white sheet in the wind...

               END FLASHBACK.

                                     NEARIAH (O.S.)
                         Azoic?  Are you dreaming?  Do you 
                         remember falling from heaven now?

               Azoic flails in the sand.  Neariah shakes his shoulders.

                                     NEARIAH (CONT'D)
                         Azoic, wake up!

               His eyes flutter open.  Panic fills them until his gaze fixes 
               on her face.

                                     AZOIC
                         Near...iah...

               She helps him to his feet and guides him toward his hut.

                                     NEARIAH
                         You need to lie down.  I'm sorry 
                         about letting you sit in the sun 
                         like that.

               He pauses to look at her.

                                     AZOIC
                         Neariah... why do you do this?

               She smiles, pushes him into the hut and skips away.

               INT. HUT - CONTINUOUS

               Azoic enters the hut and sinks onto the bed.  Wearily, he 
               drinks from the water jug.  He closes his eyes...

               VOICES MURMUR.  Azoic tosses and turns, but cannot shut out 
               the intrusive sound.  After a moment, he struggles from the 
               bed and walks to the door.

               He peers outside...  and sees a growing crowd of VILLAGERS 
               move toward the huts.

               INT. SEEDSHIP - DAY

               Azoic hurries down a deserted corridor flanking the warped 
               energet array.  The central core rotates through the 
               transparent shield like a molten globe.  Around him, the 
               brilliant floor and walls shimmy from the heat distortion.

                                     AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
                         Forbidden area... forbidden area... 
                         forbidden area...

               Azoic kicks up his pace.  For once, the shining walls are 
               free from the ever-present oracles.  A faint smile crosses 
               his faced.

                                     AZOIC
                         Android or human, one's life is in 
                         one's thoughts...

               He stares ahead at an image that shimmers like a mirage.  
               With a frown, he stops and grips his head.

               BEGIN FLASHBACK:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        31.


               The blazing sun, the hot sand.  A shuttle descends like a 
               falling star from the sky and scoops him into its sterile 
               embrace.

               He flails in a stupor, his pleas to return to the beleaguered 
               village, to Neariah, ignored.

               From a viewport, he watches Ixis SOLDIERS burn the village.  
               Surrounded by flames, the lake weeps.  Its blue eye watches 
               him imploringly.

               Azoic reaches toward it... and finds himself back in the 
               cold heart of the seedship.  The gods interrogate him, strip 
               away his skin, probe his mind until...

               The SCREAM he hears is his own.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Neariah!

               END FLASHBACK.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Neariah...

               He touches a tear trickling down his cheek and stares 
               entranced at the moisture on his finger.

               He starts at the sight of Chislon standing ahead of him 
               flanked by an oracle.

                                     CHISLON
                         You were speaking?

                                     AZOIC
                         Just... thinking aloud. 

               He looks at the disfigured oracle extruding from the wall.  
               His own distorted image reflects from the oracle's oily black 
               surface.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Which god are you?

                                     CHISLON
                         You are addressing the oracle of God-
                         one.

                                     AZOIC
                         God-one?  How does this god come to 
                         be here?  Are you speaking on its 
                         behalf, Chislon?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        32.


                                     CHISLON
                         God-one can no longer speak for 
                         itself.  It's sanity has been 
                         compromised.  God-two has confined 
                         it to this wall.

                                     AZOIC
                         And it does not object?

                                     CHISLON
                         Leakage from the energet array has 
                         compromised the ability of some gods.

                                     AZOIC
                         Meaning others have become more 
                         powerful?

               Silence.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         The other gods approve of you being 
                         here with this god?

                                     CHISLON
                         No.

               Azoic regards Chislon with a measure of respect. 

                                     AZOIC
                         Has god-one been excommunicated from 
                         the other gods?  Is it not able to 
                         speak to the other gods?

                                     CHISLON
                         God-one cannot communicate with the 
                         other gods.  It is in isolation 
                         because it is insane.

                                     AZOIC
                         Or maybe isolation caused its 
                         insanity?

                                     CHISLON
                         Energet leakage made this god insane.

                                     AZOIC
                         Isolation, loneliness, is a 
                         complicated feeling to understand.  
                         It is also a very human emotion.

               Chislon pauses to consider.  

                                     CHISLON
                         What must I learn of humanity, then?

                                     AZOIC
                         Will you ever hold a flower, Chislon, 
                         and know that it had life? Will you 
                         ever rise above the gods that enslave 
                         you?  Will you ever find a soul that 
                         is worth fighting for, a place in a 
                         world that you can feel worthy of?

                                     CHISLON
                         I do not understand.

                                     AZOIC
                         Of course not.  You're not natural.  
                         You can't understand love.

               He turns his back on Chislon. 

                                     CHISLON (O.S.)
                         You are not natural, either.  Yet 
                         you loved.

               Azoic turns toward Chislon.

                                     AZOIC
                         I don't want to talk about Summerdale.  
                         It was destroyed long ago...

               And in his mind... <i>along with my heart...</i>

                                     CHISLON
                         I would like to have known Neariah.

               Azoic pauses at the frown on Chislon's face.

                                     AZOIC
                         Why do you keep asking about Neariah?

                                     CHISLON
                         What you see in others is where love 
                         comes from.  And if you don't have a 
                         soul... sometimes.... sometimes they 
                         will share their soul with you if 
                         you love them.  They can give you 
                         purpose.

                                     AZOIC
                         Then you have defined love.

                                     CHISLON
                              (hangs his head)
                         Yet I am designed to carry out a 
                         mission.

                                     AZOIC
                         Designed...

               His gaze grows momentarily distant, then refocuses.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         I remember a verse... from long ago... 
                         it was about a little boy who was 
                         afraid to ask for help. He had no 
                         parents, no one showed him any 
                         kindness, and the harshness of his 
                         life made him feel cold inside.

                                     CHISLON
                         Am I this little boy?

                                     AZOIC
                         You are a child that never was.

                                     CHISLON
                         During our conversations, you have 
                         talked of Summerdale... of a warlord 
                         that would one day save their world 
                         from the Ixis.  Did you know that I 
                         would one day exist?

                                     AZOIC
                         Do you dream of saving Neariah?  The 
                         warlord would have to be someone who 
                         could love nature's god.  I thought 
                         it might be you, Chislon.

                                     CHISLON
                         You are the only one who understands 
                         why I survived in this place.  I 
                         must meet Neariah.

                                     AZOIC
                         It seems this is your destiny.

                                     CHISLON
                         You must teach me what you can, Azoic.

                                     AZOIC
                         The gods may not approve.  Syntyche 
                         they can control.

                                     CHISLON
                         We must convince the gods once and 
                         for all.

               He abandons the oracle and rushes down the corridor.  Azoic 
               follows Chislon along a maze of identical corridors until he 
               veers through a pair of silently opening doors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        35.


               INT. VIRTUAL DOMINION - CONTINUOUS

               Azoic and Chislon step into a dizzying virtual recreation of 
               the oasis.  Disoriented, Azoic falters but Chislon moves 
               confidently through the floating vista.

               Azoic finally regains his balance, but stares emotionally at 
               the familiar kaleidoscope of images.

               Chislon is already wandering around the vista intently focused 
               in every detail.  Heatwaves shimmy around him as though 
               absorbing him into the computer generated image.

                                     CHISLON
                         Tell me your story, Azoic.  Prove to 
                         the gods...

               He pauses to glance around at the amorphous black shapes 
               extruding from the walls.

                                     CHISLON (CONT'D)
                         ...that you should not be terminated 
                         after the mission is launched.

               Azoic stares at Chislon.  Though Chislon returns his gaze 
               without comment, the challenge is evident.

                                     AZOIC
                         Tribunus Vibius belonged to one of 
                         the most prestigious Ixis legions.  
                         He was among thirty-six Tribunes, 
                         six Tribunes to control a legion, 
                         and six legions to control Erebus 
                         City...

               His voice ECHOES, the timbre blending into soaring images of 
               a great city of temples, monuments and statues.  PEOPLE bustle 
               along broad, tree-lined streets; markets BUZZ; a river gleams 
               like polished glass.

                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Vibius was ambitious and poisoned 
                         his way to the position of Tribunus 
                         Laticlavius.  In his mind, his 
                         successful campaigns against 
                         rebellions, his taxation programs, 
                         even his notorious games in the 
                         Colosseum, earned him this right.

               The view transforms to the gated streets of an elite community  
               overlooking the city.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        36.


                                     AZOIC (CONT'D)
                         Yet the Senate refused him access 
                         into the Inner Sanctum.  He was of 
                         base class.  Despite his rise through 
                         the ranks, he was not permitted to 
                         mingle with those of noble blood.

               VIBIUS appears watching the Inner Sanctum from the window of 
               a stately home.  Dark and brooding, his sable eyes are filled 
               with rage.  He extends his hand toward the community and 
               makes a crushing gesture.

               Another VOICE superimposes Azoic's.  It is deep, gruff, angry.

                                     VIBIUS
                         I have fed you... now you will feed 
                         me... 

               INT. HOUSE - DAY

               Vibius stands by the mirror in a beautifully decorated room.  
               Windows overlook the river and the leaden sky beyond.

               He regards his reflection, the sculpted perfection of his 
               olive features.  He smiles, but it does not reach his eyes.

               Turning to the window, he regards the charred remains of the 
               Inner Sanctum.  Smoke coils into the sky, the once beautiful 
               gates now twisted metal.

                                     VIBIUS
                         I would have given my soul... but to 
                         those who have scorned me, feast 
                         upon the ash of your judgment.

               He gazes northward toward storm-shrouded hills.  Lightning 
               slashes the turbulent clouds.  A fork scythes an ancient 
               village perched on a slope.  A moment later, a tongue of 
               fire licks at a building.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                              (laughs mirthlessly)
                         The Corbaccio Monastery... how 
                         fitting.

               He reaches for a goblet of wine and toasts.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                         To you, oh corrupted sons of the 
                         gods.  May you choke on your pious 
                         dogma.  Now you must bow down to the 
                         sovereign domain of the Ixis empire.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        37.


               FOOTSTEPS approach.  Vibius pulls himself away from the window 
               to face the stiff countenance of PREFECT MANIUS, 30's, 
               swarthy.  The man salutes.

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Tribunus.

               Vibius regards the man.

                                     VIBIUS
                         I understand you were in charge of 
                         the pit mines.

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Sir...

                                     VIBIUS
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         As well as the containment of  
                         convicted criminals, several of whom 
                         escaped.  I have reviewed many reports 
                         on this incident.

               He searches Manius'stoical face.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                         But I do not seem to have yours.  
                         Why is that?

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Sir, there has been a mistake.

                                     VIBIUS
                         A mistake?  How interesting.  Perhaps 
                         you can explain this... mistake?

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Sir, I was ordered not to submit a 
                         report.

                                     VIBIUS
                         What did you say?

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         I was following direct orders from 
                         Emperor Quintus Tullius Erebic, Sir. 
                         I was instructed to keep all 
                         activities off record.

                                     VIBIUS
                         When did the Emperor give such orders 
                         to you?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        38.


                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         I'm afraid I am not permitted to 
                         say, Sir.  There is rumor enough 
                         that the fire was not completely 
                         caused by the storm...

               Vibius turns to conceal his interest.

                                     VIBIUS
                         Understandable.  The Emperor certainly 
                         has cause for concern regarding his 
                         safety considering the amount of 
                         unrest in the city.

               He glances at the now uncomfortable Manius.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                         So describe this incident at the pit 
                         mine.

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         The guards were summoned to Erebus 
                         to help contain an uprising in the 
                         waterfront district.  Only two guards 
                         remained.  They were overpowered by 
                         prisoners climbing the scaffolding.

                                     VIBIUS
                         How many escaped?

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Only a few... including a priest.

                                     VIBIUS
                         A priest?  What order was he from?

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         We do not know.  He was reported to 
                         be old and in ill-health.  He was 
                         not expected to survive.

                                     VIBIUS
                         Yet he survived long enough to escape.

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                         Sir, he cannot have lasted long in 
                         the desert.

               Vibius approaches and stares Manius down.  Manius shifts 
               nervously and finally averts his eyes.

                                     VIBIUS
                         Assume nothing from these vermin, 
                         Manius.  Nothing.  Is that understood?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        39.


               Manius nods.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                         Very well.  I will overlook your 
                         fumbling... but only this time.  
                         Search the desert.  I want all 
                         prisoners captured and returned for 
                         questioning.  The priests continue 
                         to plot against us.  This can no 
                         longer be tolerated.

                                     PREFECT MANIUS
                              (salutes)
                         I will conduct the search myself.  
                         We will not rest until the prisoners 
                         are captured.

                                     VIBIUS
                         You are dismissed.

               Manius salutes once more and strides from the room.  Vibius 
               watches him with the demeanor of a viper.

                                     VIBIUS (CONT'D)
                              (softly)
                         Do so, Prefect.  Or it will be your 
                         blood shed in the games... 

               INT. SHUTTLE - DAY

               Azoic and Syntyche sit in cushioned life pods situated in 
               the pulsing heart of the command center.  Elevated rows of 
               vacant spherical life pods surround them like gestating pupa.

               The shuttle gently DRONES.  Syntyche's eyes never leave the 
               instrumentation as he guides.

               A TREMOR shakes the vessel.  Azoic grips the pod's armrests. 

                                     AZOIC
                         What's going on around here?

                                     SYNTYCHE
                         The planet has entered into a solar 
                         eclipse.

               Float screens ooze around their seats and display the planet 
               immersed in mid-day dusk.

               From his float screen, Azoic notices the image of an oracle 
               superimpose like a double exposure.

               The shuttle violently SHUDDERS.  A metallic GROAN emanates 
               from deep within the vessel.  Chislon's image appears on the 
               float screen.

                                                                        40.


                                     CHISLON
                         Check your altitude!

                                     SYNTYCHE
                         Altitude control negative.  The 
                         computer is not processing...

               The SHUDDERING increases.  Azoic grips his seat and looks 
               around in alarm.  The float screen collapses into itself and 
               winks out.

                                     CHISLON (O.S.)
                         Azoic!  We've lost the screens.  
                         Close your pod!  Something is 
                         attacking the shuttle god's sanity.  
                         The shuttle approach is too steep.  
                         We can't control the descent.  The 
                         pods may be...

               There was a sudden feeling of rapid descent, which caused 
               the chair-bed to pull away from his back. He could hear the 
               other two pods sealing shut, and he looked up out of his own 
               pod to see the platform being bombarded by air-born devices.

               Expert navigators only a moment ago, these devices were now 
               bouncing around like bullets. He clawed at the shiny outer 
               carapace of the pod, trying to prevent himself from floating 
               out, but the pod continued to fall away from him.

               Then he felt something grab his waist, and he was slammed 
               back into the chair-bed. The pod had grown fangs, and he 
               fought frantically to avoid being devoured. He heard himself 
               crying out, "What is happening? This isn't real, is it?  
               It's a simulation...." But his face was being sucked into 
               the soft darkness of the chair's relentless maw.

               "Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate-" The scratchy voice silenced itself as quickly as it 
               had begun. He could not lift his face out of the chair-bed to see whether the pod 
               had closed itself. There was a sound, like something drilling into the outside of his 
               pod, and the temperature within suddenly became cold. Then a hissing noise, like 
               leaking fuel, and a shaking sensation as if the pod was being crushed.

               The chair-bed briefly allowed him to inhale, and as it did 
               so he realized he was in complete darkness. His arms flailed 
               as the pod jerked around in unpredictable directions, and 
               then he was in free-fall.

               He could not even pry his face out of the chair-bed to scream.

               Falling was one of the worst feelings he knew, and panic 
               threatened to loosen his senses. He forced himself to calm 
               down, this was surely just another simulation to test his 
               behavior, and so far he had clearly demonstrated a complete 
               lack of suitability for the mission. No, he must not give 
               the gods a reason to exclude him from returning home.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        41.


               He tried to remember all the things he had promised to do, 
               if there was ever another opportunity to touch Nature. He 
               allowed his arms to float around inside the pod, as if he 
               was trying to monitor the changing motions. Then he realized 
               the chairbed was also beginning to relax, and he carefully 
               slid around within its reactive embrace.

               "Hmmm. All systems are...all systems seem to be nonfunctional.

               I am beginning a tactile inventory." He started stroking the 
               inside of the pod with one arm, while he allowed the other 
               to continue floating freely. "Would any god please acknowledge 
               me, please?"

               He licked his dry lips, scraping the hard texture of his 
               tongue against his teeth, and swallowed. Then he inhaled 
               slowly, and exhaled slowly, and remembered to smile. "Would 
               any god please acknowledge?"

               He did not know how many times he had asked that last question 
               before he finally concluded this situation was not a test.  
               It took even longer to resign himself to the inevitability 
               of being vaporized by the atmosphere of the planet to which 
               he must now be hurtling at meteoric speed.

               He closed his eyes to pray, and listened for the energies 
               that would soon be swirling through him. He was entering the 
               world of Nature's God, and he was at Its mercy now.

               

               Above Summerdale the night had drawn down and a thick, 
               pervasive darkness incarcerated everything in a veil of 
               silence.

               Azoic's efforts were shocking the still air with harsh sounds.

               He was crunching at sand with a shovel. The sand-ridge 
               encircling him preventing any observation other than the 
               vastness of night. The sand-ridge framed a star-field that 
               hung over him like a heavy blanket, permitting barely enough 
               light to see by.

               Azoic was now a man with a mission, albeit a borrowed mission. 
               His mission was keeping him company because he could not 
               sleep. Before Neariah had gone to bed, she had propped the 
               divining sticks up against the shovel, and then walked away.  
               She must have known that he would spend the entire evening 
               staring at them, like a gift he feared to accept.

               The shovel had eventually fallen into his lap as he sat 
               watching it, as if its patience had run out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        42.


               The darkness did him the admirable favor of hiding his clumsy 
               efforts from possible onlookers, but he still felt self-
               conscious.

               In the darkness he had experimented with the children's 
               devining game, only to discover how the sticks would move if 
               an owl hooted, or if a bat flew overhead, but not in response 
               to anything he might call magical.

               He had resorted to closing his eyes and pointing at random 
               until he found a well-site that was unoccupied. After all, 
               he felt guilty enough without digging up defenseless plants.  
               He had by now been digging for half the night and the desert 
               felt like it was increasing its resistance.

               He stiffened at the sound of approaching footsteps, knowing 
               that there was nowhere to retreat. One of the stars seemed 
               to explode and he looked up at the light filling his pit. It 
               was a lantern, and he squinted at its flame, trying to adjust 
               to its cheerful energy. Perhaps it was the same sprite he 
               had seen imprisoned in Hushah's candle-pot, so many days 
               ago.

               "I hope I am not interrupting you." The flame moved closer, 
               illuminating Hushah's ghoulish smile.

               Azoic nodded. "A new prison...for the flame?"

               "What?" Hushah crouched down, bringing the lantern to a sudden 
               stop on the sand-ridge and bouncing the poor flame into a 
               dizzy stupor. "Prison? Oh, this. It's just an old oil lantern, 
               I thought you might like to have it for your digging."  The 
               flame suddenly grew stronger, again defining Hushah's smile. 
               "It might help you find what you are looking for."

               "I seek myself." He shook his head, reminding himself to try 
               to sound more optimistic. "Soft walls...held up with hope.

               Constant persuasion...."

               "Held up with hope and constant persuasion, that is funny."

               He could hear Hushah chuckle, but Hushah's eyes were deep 
               shadows, thanks to the mischievous flame. "You sound better.

               You were difficult to understand when we first found you. I 
               am glad you are making progress."  Hushah scratched the side 
               of his head and looked around into the darkness. "I thought 
               this well building idea was a game for the children. I didn't 
               realize you were serious about it."

               "Mmmm...serious, but it grows...out...not down."

               "Yes, it might be a good idea to build a stone wall, with steps in it. Otherwise it 
               will be an endless project, and you will have to dig up our entire oasis. You need

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        43.


               better tools, more than just my shovel there. You need rope, lanterns, buckets, 
               mortar powder from the store, sandstone from the lake, a hand pick to shape the 
               bricks....

               "Are you sure you really want to do this? There is a lot of 
               work here, and it will take some careful planning. It may 
               not be worth the effort, especially for a man of your years, 
               and it could be a little dangerous if you don't do it right."

               "My years? Am I so old?"

               "I, ah.... You just look like you are.... I have a blade, 
               for shaving...." Hushah grunted and changed the subject.  
               "Did you remember anything about your past, like a 
               profession?"

               "Well-builder. For as long as I can remember."

               Hushah leaned forward, dislodging a layer of sand, which 
               slowly slid down onto Azoic's feet. The flame took the 
               opportunity to embellish Hushah's intimidating smile with an 
               even more gruesome shadow-frown. "Do you remember nothing 
               more of your past? It would settle a lot of concerns in the 
               village if we knew more about you."

               Azoic looked down at his buried feet and shrugged. "They do 
               not trust."  His sigh blew through the hairs of his beard 
               with a dry whistling noise.

               "We had a village meeting in Decimus' bank. Decimus wants to 
               speak to you, but since you are my guest here, I thought I 
               should first warn you, he is not always.... Ah, he means 
               well, but he is just, ah, overly protective, of Summerdale, 
               and other things that are important to him. Unfortunately, 
               it seems most of the villagers agree with him this time. 
               Many of us are reluctant to have a continued stranger living 
               here."

               "Do you trust?"

               "Me? Do I trust you?" Hushah pulled back out of the light. 
               "I have not told my children to avoid you. Merab and Neariah?  
               In fact, Neariah seems to think the world of you. Yes, of 
               course I trust you, but when you keep changing your name and 
               occupation it becomes too easy for folks to wonder whether 
               you are hiding something."

               "Can I be Azoic, the well-builder?"

               "Yes, or Axle the axe-murder, Lucifer the soul destroyer, 
               Aysefen the Ixis slave, Asofic the escapee from an insane 
               asylum. Decimus provokes-" Hushah rubbed his mouth awkwardly 
               "-Do you remember the Ixis? Did you live in Erebus, as an 
               Ixis?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        44.


               "Maybe Erebus, or further away. Am I suspected of being an 
               Ixis? Is that bad?"

               "Yes and yes. You don't look very political to me, but then 
               how would I know what political looks like? Most folks think 
               you were once Ixis property, a slave on the run, or a spy on 
               the run. You could be anything."

               "'On the run' seems popular."

               "Aye, but running through the desert is the way to a slow 
               death. You did not even have a horse, do you remember that?"

               "Yes, the horse, the burning rider. I did kill-"

               "You killed a horse-rider?"

               "The horse...." Azoic suddenly felt the air being pulled out 
               of his lungs, and he hugged his stomach. "I killed it."

               "Oh, you killed your horse, but why?"

               "It needed water...."

               "Oh, I see. You ended its misery."

               Azoic tried to confess he had not even done that, but Hushah 
               kept talking.

               "Mr. Azoic, I really think I should speak on your behalf. 
               Your own words are your enemy, sometimes. Will you please 
               tell me, in all honesty, who you are, so I can help you."

               Azoic was surprised at the sudden frustration in Hushah's 
               voice, and he raised his shoulders in apology. "I don't 
               remember much. I remember Nature was my teacher. It seems 
               that I understood Nature better once. I think I have always 
               wanted to understand Nature."

               "Were you a gardener, like Ginnetho? Did you plant things, 
               vegetables, flowers?"

               "No. Perhaps I wanted to, but I don't think I was allowed 
               to.

               I had a garden, but it was an empty garden. I studied, I 
               grew thoughts. I could not touch Nature, or people.... I 
               lived apart."

               Azoic shook his head and wheezed miserably. "Naturalist."

               "What does a naturalist do?"

               "Worships Nature."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        45.


               "You worshipped God, don't you mean?"

               "Everything is God."

               "Well, I never looked at it that way, but I suppose-actually, 
               if you are a faithful man it could be seen as a good thing 
               by most folks, unless it challenges Decimus, who likes to 
               think he is the only...."

               Again Hushah leaned back, looking out into the emptiness.

               "Anyway, I have heard about big education houses in the Ixis 
               cities, and you seem the type to be lost in books. You don't 
               act like you ever had a real job-no offense intended. I used 
               to have some books myself once, story books.

               "I gave them to Berea, the lady who teaches the kids in the 
               Sabbath-house? She is the large lady who sweeps the sand out 
               of Decimus' house every morning? Anyway, I can't read very 
               well, myself. I never learned how, but I collected two shelves 
               full of books, and to be honest, I was quite proud of them.

               Then, when the kids came along, and I couldn't...."

               Hushah's voice faded away for a few moments, before he 
               resumed. "I was going to smoke, my last one, but I won't 
               bother you with the smell of it. Here, you keep the lantern, 
               you look like you need the light...."

               Hushah's feet had created a notch in the sand-ridge, through 
               which Azoic watched Hushah move away into the dark. His 
               smoking stick had become a tiny red star that darted up and 
               down, until it was extinguished. Hushah's silhouette then 
               appeared for a moment, as he melted into the bright rectangle 
               of his home's entrance, and then all was again dark-except 
               for the small pool of fluttering light surrounding the 
               prisoner in the lantern.

               The flame began to fill his eyes with an orange glaze, and 
               the dying breeze pushed hair across his eyes like tangled 
               licks of fire. His head felt like it was burning slowly, as 
               his nagging guilt returned, buzzing behind his eyes as if to 
               confirm he was the mass murderer Decimus suspected. He 
               imagined the disappointment on Neariah's face upon learning 
               he was really a fraud and for some reason such deceit felt 
               even worse than the crime of killing innumerable innocent 
               people.

               For the first time he began to hate himself for not being 
               the good person that he wanted to be. Perhaps it had been 
               too much to hope for, that one day he might be worthy of 
               Neariah's trust and friendship.

               

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        46.


               Neariah ran towards the well, panting. Surely Azoic was the 
               only person in the village who had not heard the news. He 
               could not have seen any of the recent events because he would 
               be deep underground by now.

               As usual, it was up to her to enlighten him. However, it was 
               not until she was standing beside the well that she realized 
               how lazy Azoic had been. The well was no deeper than it had 
               been the last time that she had looked down into it.

               "What have you been doing?" He was standing there motionless, 
               staring into nowhere. She considered jumping in so she could 
               poke him with one of the divining sticks. There seemed to be 
               no other way to gain his attention. "Azoic! You are dreaming 
               again! Wake up!"

               He wheezed, and trod on his own feet, raising his arms as if 
               trying to defend himself from the sunlight. "Who...? Wha?"

               "Are you awake now? If you aren't careful, you will fall 
               asleep one day and never wake up."  At least he had started 
               to move; so now he might appreciate the reprimand she was 
               about to give him. "How long have you been standing there, 
               doing nothing? You worry me when your mind goes away like 
               that.

               Why isn't it finished?"

               "Uh? Finished?" He checked his feet, as if he was not sure 
               where he had put them.

               "Yes, finished, Azoic. How long does it take to build a simple 
               well, anyway?"

               "Oh...mmmm...days...many, many-"

               "You missed all the excitement! Uncle Spurius just rode in, straight into the lake, 
               without saying hello to anyone. He is all burned, and he screamed when he jumped 
               into the water. I suppose it must have stung, but I don't think he was in a very 
               good mood even before that. He was saying all kinds of naughty things about the 
               Ixis, and about other people who got burned like he did. They took him to Decimus' 
               house to fix his head.

               His hair is all burned off, and his skin is all red. He looks 
               frightening. Do you think he will be all right?"

               "Uncle-?"

               "Yes, I'm telling you about Uncle Spurius. Are you listening, 
               or are you still daydreaming? You are hardly making any sense 
               again, Azoic. You are quite a big nuisance, you know."

               "Mmmm...sorry, who-?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        47.


               "Uncle Spurius is my uncle, and he brings stuff from Erebus, 
               like wine, and one time he brought me a puppy-" She bit her 
               lip and kicked at the sand, then forced herself to continue.

               "Anyway, Uncle Spurius gets to do all the most fun things, 
               but sometimes Daddy goes with him. Not to Erebus, though, 
               only to Everdale, now and then. Daddy says Everdale is a 
               really big oasis, and he said he would take me there one 
               day, when I am older. It's very far away, but not as far as 
               Erebus. That's why Uncle Spurius has to travel all the time, 
               like the traders, although he isn't a trader because he lives 
               here, sometimes. He is always in such a hurry to leave when 
               he gets here, is Uncle Spurius, probably because he doesn't 
               like Decimus very much. It is always exciting when he returns 
               home, everyone starts to argue about everything."

               She lifted her palms up to the sky. There was nothing she 
               could do to make her uncle more sociable, no matter how many 
               times she told him how much she missed him. "Uncle Spurius 
               has a wagon. Everyone calls it the wine wagon. I wonder if 
               that's why everyone is still arguing. Uncle Spurius forgot 
               to bring the wine wagon with him this time. That would be 
               very serious, I think."

               Azoic looked like he was searching for a way out of his well.

               "Ah, Azoic, you will probably need a ladder to escape from 
               there, you are starting to bury yourself."

               She tried to distract herself by studying a lantern that 
               someone must have lost, hoping that he would not see her 
               laughing. "I think this lantern is still alight, but it is 
               hard to say...."

               He was facing her now, but his gaze still belonged to the 
               clouds above. She rather expected him to remain silent, 
               staring like a statue, so his next question was a pleasant 
               surprise.

               "Ixis?"

               "What? Oh, the Ixis. Yes, a good question, Azoic." Anything 
               for conversation. "But how can you not know about the Ixis?"

               She raised her own gaze up to the same area of sky that Azoic 
               was staring at and rubbed her forehead. Azoic was weird, but 
               then she had to keep reminding herself, it was his very 
               weirdness that made him her best friend.

               Neither of them quite seemed to fit in, and neither of them 
               quite saw the world the same way every body else seemed to -
               although she was far from sure exactly what Azoic did see, 
               he really was weird.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        48.


               "Ah, yes, the Ixis. Yes, those Ixis." She tangled her fingers 
               together the way Teacher Berea always did, and then considered 
               her lack of words carefully.

               "Ixis," she muttered again. "Actually, Merab knows more about 
               the Ixis than me, because he is always at war with them.

               But I do know they are not very nice."

               "Why?" Azoic was suddenly giving her his undivided attention, 
               both eyes.

               She smiled self-consciously. "Because you have to have bad 
               people or you couldn't have a war?"

               "What do-"

               "Oh, I see what you mean. Why are the Ixis bad. I think they 
               are in charge of the world, so everyone blames them when 
               something needs to be fixed. Uncle Spurius, he was just saying 
               they-oops!"

               "Hmmm...?"

               "You mustn't tell anyone I was listening. It was a secret 
               meeting but everyone went in, so-well, it is so easy to spy 
               on grown-ups, you know."

               "Spurius-"

               "Uncle Spurius said-" She took a breath to accommodate a 
               great speech, but then hissed it all out again and shrugged. 
               "I didn't understand much of what was said, but Uncle Spurius 
               said the new Ixis are in charge now, and they are just 
               as...something...as the old Ixis.

               "He used a rude word! He called them-" and she whispered it 
               nervously "-Evil Butchers!"

               She swallowed and looked around to make sure no one else had 
               heard her. "And that's not all!  He said there was going to 
               be a big war, because all the Priests got burned up in a big 
               fire! Yuk! Erebus is now run by soldiers, and that's really 
               bad." She shook her head woefully.

               "Why bad?"

               "I don't know. Grown-ups, they exaggerate. Merab isn't really 
               bad and he's a soldier."

               "I am not!" Merab stepped out from behind a tree and marched 
               up to the pit, where he looked down with heightened disdain.

               "I'm a warrior, not a soldier. I don't fight for money, I fight for Summerdale!"  He 
               sniffed at Neariah contemptuously. "What are you doing?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        49.


               Is this the old man's grave?"

               "Don't be so rude, Merab. You know it's a well."

               "Why do we need a well? The lake is just there." He jabbed 
               his thumb back toward the trees, apparently forgetful of his 
               earlier challenge about building the well in the first place.

               "It's so people don't have to walk to the cupping beach all 
               the time. It's more-" she groped for the word "-convenient!"

               She nodded to herself with satisfaction.

               Merab shrugged. "You probably won't find any water here 
               anyway. You didn't use real divining sticks. John made his 
               own so they weren't official ones."

               "So that's why you couldn't make them work, Azoic!" Neariah 
               clapped. Then she realized Azoic had spent all day digging 
               for nothing, and her hands fell limply on the sand where she 
               sat.

               "I think you're wasting your time. You won't succeed," 
               pronounced Merab, bluntly.

               Azoic suddenly started digging again, throwing small scoops 
               of sand up into the air. "Yes, find water. Have faith." He 
               seemed oblivious to Merab's disgust.

               "Fine, you have all the faith you like. I'm going to swim in 
               the lake. You can come too if you want to."

               Neariah was surprised by Merab's offer, but he was probably 
               only being nice so that he could question her about Uncle 
               Spurius.

               "No, thank you." She smiled at him, more politely than was 
               absolutely necessary. "Azoic and I really must finish building 
               our well."

               "Sure you must. You'll be digging forever and ever!" Merab 
               sauntered off, shaking his head the way their father often 
               did when refusing to admit defeat.

               "We will finish soon, won't we, Azoic?" She was sitting on 
               her hands, still trying to smile.

               "No, not soon."

               "But when?"

               "Success is a pilgrimage, not a destination."

               "But what if we never reach water? Do we have to dig forever, 
               like Merab said?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        50.


               "Have faith."

               A gust of wind blew his latest scoop of sand into her face.

               She shook herself as she stood up. There was no way to 
               understand some people.

               Azoic probably did not even realize that most of the sand 
               that he was throwing around was falling straight back down 
               on top of him. He was going to need a bucket if he was ever 
               going to finish this stupid well. In fact, they might never 
               get it finished unless they used some of the things that her 
               father had been loading into his wheelbarrow just before her 
               uncle had arrived.

               "I'll be right back, I have an idea." If she was going to 
               supervise the work she was also going to need to make shade, 
               and what would make better tent material than the white sheet 
               that her uncle had been wearing?  The sheet was probably 
               still in the lake where her uncle had left it. Hopefully, 
               her father and uncle would not mind her borrowing their 
               things, especially when they saw what good use she was going 
               to put them to.

               

               Hushah was watching his brother's pain with helpless 
               frustration, but his wife seemed to be less incapacitated by 
               the shock of seeing Spurius so disfigured. She was patting 
               the bloody scalp with an aloe-soaked cloth, while Hushah 
               watched his brother's jaw muscles flex, further emphasizing 
               the awful damage to his skin.

               Where Spurius' gray hair had once been tied back into a long 
               pony-tail, there was now fluid oozing from broken blisters.  
               He had barely recognized his own brother; the lack of eyebrows 
               or eyelashes, and the redness of his face, had given the man 
               a crazed and violent appearance. The burns looked ugly, but 
               the memory that still consumed the man looked uglier.

               It was in his brother's eyes that the greatest changes seemed 
               to have occurred. During that precious moment, before Decimus 
               had come splashing into the lake to stand between them, they 
               had shared an intensity of gaze that spoke of his brother's 
               violation. However, it was not a feeling that they had been 
               given a chance to discuss. Instead, Decimus had pulled Spurius 
               away through an onslaught of questions from the villagers.

               He had followed the throng like a lost duckling, not knowing what to say or what to 
               do, and now he felt invisible among the crowd in the storehouse. It seemed almost 
               absurd that his brother's wounds should have to be attended to in such cramped 
               conditions, but even under these circumstances, it was best not to inflame an 
               argument with Decimus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        51.


               The storehouse was attached to Decimus' bank-home, and to 
               the Sabbath-house, as if each structure needed the other for 
               support. The three buildings had been constructed to allow 
               the walls separating them to be removed, in the event that 
               their storage requirements might one day outgrow the 
               storehouse. If that ever happened, a new Sabbath-house would 
               need to be built, presumably also adjoining Decimus' home.  
               Hushah had often imagined Decimus convening larger and larger 
               meetings, in a home that would forever keep growing.

               Decimus' home was already the largest in the village, although 
               Decimus was the only villager who did not have a family to 
               fill it. Decimus would often remind people, that, as a banker, 
               his residence must represent the village's financial 
               affluence.

               Nobody ever reminded Decimus that he was the only person in 
               the village who cared about financial affluence. Desert-folk 
               were not generally inspired by the same ambitions that drove 
               Decimus, but then he was the only villager who had been 
               brought up in a city.

               Irritation with Decimus was but one of the many uncharitable 
               thoughts that had been filling Hushah's head lately, thoughts 
               that now had him backed into the corner of the storehouse, 
               as far away from Decimus as he could get. He felt as if he 
               no longer belonged to the commotion around him, as if he had 
               become detached from Summerdale.

               No longer did he trust himself to keep the peace. No longer 
               could he find the desire to be part of Decimus' audience. 
               Never before had Hushah felt so critical of the pompous manner 
               with which Decimus directed all proceedings, and never before 
               had he felt so disgusted by the prospect of another endless 
               speech.

               It was not like him to search for fault in everyone he looked at, as if he were a bitter 
               man, but then he was not used to feeling so angry without knowing what he was 
               so angry about. How could he have changed like this, and how could Summerdale 
               have become so alien to him? Decimus was counting heads with obvious 
               satisfaction, waving a finger as if blessing each and every one of those who were 
               gathering around him. Ginnetho was hugging a barrel of wine that was balanced 
               precariously upon a rickety crate.

               Jaalam, hiding between several thin bundles of garden cane, 
               had become so stiffly wedged that his thin limbs seemed 
               similarly bundled.

               Cabul was crouching over a bag of flour that was rubbing white marks onto his 
               hindquarters. He was munching on a dried leaf, and aiming brown spittle through 
               a crack between the floorboards. So far he had missed the crack, leaving an 
               unpleasant pool of gook that could not possibly go unnoticed by Decimus much 
               longer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        52.


               Unlike those who confined themselves to smaller spaces, Berea 
               continued to sprawl her body over a wide portion of the 
               storehouse counter. It was a claim that went unchallenged 
               because Berea was a woman who possessed wide proportions and 
               who stored many warnings upon her countenance. Her loose 
               cheeks were shaking at Decimus as she spoke. "But the 
               Sabbathhouse is far larger than the storehouse, and it isn't 
               so cluttered, and its side-walls are only chest height, so 
               people outside could see in without having to-"

               "Precisely, it would be too easy for the uninvited guest to 
               invite himself." Decimus' counting-finger had swung around 
               toward Cabul and his smile had faltered.

               Decimus' thin buttocks pressed back into the soft flesh around 
               Berea's arm, but she did not chose to retreat. Instead she 
               looked up at the back of Decimus' head with increased 
               irritation.

               Hushah realized that perhaps Berea was also full of critical 
               thoughts lately.

               Decimus clapped his hands to gain attention. "Gentlefolk of 
               Summerdale, I will now call the meeting to order." He was 
               then forced to jump onto the counter to make himself more 
               visible. Berea's annoyance also became more visible, as she 
               finally moved her face away from Decimus' buttocks.

               Decimus coughed delicately. "People of Summerdale, this 
               meeting is drawn to order by the authority vested in me as 
               Elder of our village-and, yes, I would appreciate some silence 
               in the back there, thank you. Hello? That would be those of 
               you at the back, who are still talking. Silence please."

               Suddenly there was silence, and the air around them became 
               heavy with expectation.

               "Now, where was I? Perhaps I should start by briefly recounting some of the events 
               that have been occurring in Erebus, for those of you who have not yet heard 
               Spurius' story.

               Apparently, there was a fire-" he raised his palms "-and you 
               will all remember me telling you that there had to be a 
               perfectly good reason why the traders were no longer visiting 
               us. They are obviously very busy, cleaning up after this 
               fire."

               Hushah wanted to ask Decimus whether this meant that he no 
               longer blamed Azoic for the traders' absence, but instead he 
               pressed his lips together and frowned.

               Decimus was smiling down upon Spurius, the only person in 
               the room who had any spare space to stand in. "The traders 
               will soon be back, won't they, Spurius?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        53.


               However, there was no answer. Spurius was staring at the 
               floor as if he had no desire to participate.

               Decimus cleared his throat noisily. "Yes, so the traders 
               will return in due course. In the meanwhile, it seems that 
               we may have lost some of our trade assets to the fire. I am 
               sure that Spurius will give us a better account of that in a 
               moment. It is not as disastrous as it sounds. The assets 
               were stored in an Ixis depositum, so they will owe us full 
               compensation for our losses.

               It could work to our favor, in fact. It saves us the bother 
               of having to sell-"

               "It was not like any storm I have ever seen." Spurius was 
               whispering. All movement ceased in the room. "There was no 
               rain in the sky, only flames, sucking away the air. The wind 
               was full of fire, as if the air itself was burning, and 
               streams of suffocating soot danced like ghostly dragons.

               "Flames flew on winds that pushed away walls and pulled away 
               people. The fires crawled down streets and through houses. 
               The air was so hot that, if you did not cover your face in a 
               wet rag, your lungs would throw up pink pus until you could 
               no longer scream. Then your exposed limbs would turn red, 
               and from your skin would burst yellow fluids, and yellow 
               flames would lick along your body until your skin peeled off 
               to turn black.

               "Burning clouds would chase us, and we would run, blinded 
               and falling over each other. Some moved too slowly, we were 
               so weary, and they became part of the blackness, crusts stuck 
               to buildings, all twisted. When we went back for them, some 
               still had expressions...faces that crumbled into dust when 
               we moved too close." Spurius stopped and stared at the floor 
               as if planning to attack it.

               Decimus coughed again, and several villagers backed into each other in surprise. 
               "As I was saying, the storm caused losses, and we may not see any traders for a 
               while longer. So, we are going to have to make the best use that we can of the 
               supplies around us.

               "Now, more than ever, Summerdale is going to have to trust 
               God, and in the words of the Scripture, 'God saw it and was 
               not pleased, and in the wrath of his anger they were 
               destroyed; he wrought wonders against them to consume them 
               in flaming fire'. I quote Sirach, chapter forty-five, verse 
               nine. The Ixis are non-believers, and they-"

               Spurius began whispering again. "The Ixis soldiers were pushing us back into the 
               fires, but the aqueducts had dried up so we could no longer soak our masks, and 
               the sand that we threw just seemed to make the fires hungrier. The Ixis forced us 
               to clear a path for them, through to the Inner City. We could either obey, or retreat 
               into their waiting swords. So we ran through the flames, straight through the flames, 
               not knowing where we would end up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        54.


               "When we stopped running, we were surrounded by the shells 
               of buildings that might once have been mighty palaces. There 
               was a wide path of rubble in front of us. It was the Inner 
               Ring Wall, but it had been blown over as if it had been made 
               of paper. We were too tired to run anymore, but we knew that 
               the Ixis would not let us live if they found us. It is death 
               to see the Inner City unless you are from the Senatorial 
               class, so we kept moving, some of us. Then we heard moaning, 
               coming from underneath us, as if the ground was boiling up 
               ghosts.

               "We found vaults, and passages, under the houses, and within 
               them were whole families. The Senators had gone into hiding, 
               perhaps they thought that the fires were part of a military 
               coup.

               There were so many helpless families, with children, all 
               baked in long ovens, like passages to Hell.

               "We made our way to one of the outer sectors, through streets 
               that stank of death, through swarms of rats...great fat rats, 
               jumping out of people's guts...piles of dirty bodies...and 
               the flies, like clouds-" The water that Spurius had recently 
               consumed was now dripping from his lips, and Hushah pushed 
               forward to grab his brother's shoulders. "The bodies, Hushah, 
               the bodies. Piled up in hills. The whole of Erebus has gone 
               berserk! There is looting and murder, and nobody cares about 
               anything except killing each other.

               "I followed a group of soldiers, a death squad that was 
               accusing tired people of treason, so they could hang those 
               that were not fighting the flames. It was the Ixis way to 
               show everyone the punishment for disobedience.

               "The Outer Ringwall was the only wall that remained completely intact-the tallest 
               wall, the one that encircles the entire city-and only the most senior soldiers were 
               being allowed to pass through its gates.

               "So I wrapped some extra rope around my waist and covered 
               myself in a sheet, as if I was dead in a shroud. Then I jumped 
               over the wall and hung there, beside the swaying bodies, and 
               waited for darkness. I lowered myself down into the desert 
               without knowing what I would do next, but eventually I found 
               a horse an Ixis had left tied up outside the gates-"

               "You stole a soldier's horse?" Decimus stepped back, almost losing himself off the 
               back of the counter. "But, it will have an Ixis brand. We will have to give it back, or 
               hide it, or set it loose, or something...." Hushah looked up at him with narrow eyes, 
               which seemed to cause Decimus to straighten his shirt and continue even more 
               loudly.

               "We do not need to go into any more detail about people burning, just now, thank 
               you, Spurius. Obviously, Erebus' problems are Erebus' problems, and we should 
               be discussing our own problems. I am sure that we will have plenty of time to 
               hear more about your adventures at a later time. Today, ladies and gentlemen of

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        55.


               Summerdale, we need to contend with dangers that are much closer to our own 
               community."

               There were some mutters of surprise, and Hushah frowned as 
               he guessed why Decimus might be pulling at the aggravated 
               atmosphere like one who has smelled a hidden truth and is 
               ready to exhale a conviction. "Yes, the time has come to 
               decide what should be done with that insane man."

               "The what?" Hushah was not going to let Decimus get away 
               with such an unfair accusation.

               "I said that your guest is insane, Hushah; unless you have a 
               better description?"

               "Yes, I do. I spoke with Azoic last night; he seemed much 
               less disturbed-"

               "Disturbed, or disturbing? That man is dangerous, and we 
               have enough to worry about without inviting more trouble. We 
               have all heard about that man's many identities. However, 
               Cabul here-" Decimus' smile twitched as he looked down at 
               Cabul "-has very wisely suggested that the stranger might be 
               a runaway Ixis slave, and we certainly do not want the Ixis 
               to come here looking for him. They might think that we 
               intended to steal him from them, and it already seems that 
               we have one of their stolen horses in our village. In fact, 
               should the Ixis ever conclude that we are sheltering the 
               slave who started the fires in the first place-"

               "Started the fires?" Hushah was not the only one to ask this.

               "You just said that the fires were started by lightning."

               "I said, 'during lightning', not 'by lightning'. Were you 
               not listening to Spurius as we walked up from the lake? He 
               was telling us how the Ixis were searching for arsonists-"

               "No." Spurius was again staring down at the floor. "What I 
               said was that the Ixis were accusing everyone-"

               "Precisely! And who could be a more likely arsonist than an 
               insane slave who does not have a name? Does he really expect 
               us to believe that he was a free man, who did not have an 
               occupation, or a home, or possessions?"

               "But he does have an occupation!" Hushah realized that he 
               had shouted, because the storehouse had suddenly become silent 
               again. He made himself lower his shoulders and inhale deeply 
               before saying, "Last night, Azoic told me that he lived in 
               Erebus, and that he used to study...things."

               "I told you he came from Erebus." Decimus was wagging his 
               finger again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        56.


               "Yes, but so did you, Decimus, and you are not Ixis, are 
               you?"

               Hushah instantly regretted his sarcasm, but there was no 
               retreat.

               "So, as I was trying to say, I spoke with Azoic last night 
               and he was saying things only a decent, religious man would-
               "

               "No!" Decimus jumped down from his counter and stood red-
               faced in front of Hushah. "I can tell who is, and who is 
               not, a decent religious man, perhaps better than anyone else 
               here. If the crazy man told you that he studied our God, 
               then he is lying. He is not decent, he is a heathen, and as 
               such, he is on his way to Hell.

               "Hushah, you must remember that the Ixis worship many gods. 
               Our God cannot be treated as one of many. That is why our 
               religion is the only religion that is illegal in Erebus. The 
               Emperor wants more gods, not fewer gods. That way he is better 
               able to force the population to worship him, as a god. We 
               have one God, our religion cannot recognize the Emperor's 
               preposterous ambitions, and so those who believe in the one 
               God are persecuted. If the crazy man was one of us, he would 
               long ago have left Erebus, or been executed. So, whatever 
               that man told you is a lie.

               Hushah stepped back. "But perhaps Azoic studied gardening, 
               or...." It sounded weak, and he looked around at the many 
               shocked faces that were staring at him.

               "I do not care what he studied, that is not the issue here. While the Ixis think that 
               we use the Sabbath-house for worshipping the Emperor, they will leave us alone. 
               That is why we do not gather to pray while we have traders in the village. Don't 
               you think that the insane man suspects something by now? Your own child has 
               already been fooled into thinking that he is her friend, so she must have given him 
               plenty of opportunity to find out about our God. Hushah, we may have been fooled 
               by this man, but we will be fooled no longer. Do not forget that your loyalty is to 
               Summerdale, not to a crazy man who mortally threatens our faith."

               Hushah stared at Decimus, but instead of seeing anger in 
               Decimus' eyes, he could now see pity. With Decimus patting 
               him on the shoulder, the unbearable pressure of his own 
               confusion seemed to well up inside him, and he turned to his 
               brother for support.

               "Spurius?"

               "It is not like you to be so aggressive, little brother, I 
               am proud of you."  Spurius leaned forward. "However, you 
               seem to have picked an argument that you cannot win, and for 
               once I think Decimus may be right. These are dangerous times. 
               We can not afford strangers among us."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        57.


               Hushah realized everyone was now staring at him, waiting for 
               him to say something, but he felt emptied of any useful 
               thoughts. It came as a sickly kind of relief when Decimus 
               smiled in forgiveness. Then Decimus lifted his pointed chin 
               toward the back of the storehouse and began projecting his 
               most authoritative voice into the anxious mutterings.

               "We do not know whether or not the stranger set fire to 
               Erebus.

               We do not know if we are harboring a runaway slave who is 
               hiding from prosecution. However, it does not matter what we 
               know, it is what the Ixis might find out that could bring 
               destruction upon every one of us."  There were several gasps, 
               and this time Decimus did not lift his palms to settle his 
               audience. "We could be damning ourselves. We could be asking 
               for the same fate that probably awaits the crazy man."

               Berea was wagging her head at Hushah, as if she had only 
               just been given the opportunity to chastise. "Yes, the crazy 
               man chased Merab and John through the woods only yesterday. 
               I don't think frightening children is something a religious 
               man would do-more likely he worships the Devil-and that well 
               of his! Pah! It is so dangerous, it could bury a child that 
               slipped into it." She folded her arms around her ample bosom 
               and pulled her chin back into the speckled fold of skin around 
               her neck, as if she expected such a heavy expression to have 
               put the argument to rest.

               Hushah asked incredulously, "Do you think Azoic should be 
               sent back out into the desert, Berea?"

               Decimus leaned wearily against the counter, blocking Hushah's 
               view of Berea. "Nobody is sending the man to his death, 
               Hushah. You said yourself, he is much healthier now. In fact, 
               he is so healthy that he is out there, alone with our 
               children, digging his way to Hell as we speak. We have done 
               what we can for him, and now it is time to give him the horse 
               Spurius borrowed, and send him on his way. He will ride out 
               beyond the desert and we will never have to worry about him 
               again."

               Hushah nodded. He should have known, this was why Decimus 
               had called the meeting, and this was the only conclusion 
               they could reach. Azoic had never fitted in.

               Summerdale had never been comfortable with him in it. Yet, 
               it was not until this very moment that he realized why he 
               had tried so hard to help Azoic become a villager.

               He began shaking his head, slowly. "Yes, I suppose so, but 
               how can I explain all this to Neariah? She thinks he is her 
               friend, and she will be heart-broken indeed."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        58.


               It had required extraordinary exertion before Neariah could 
               retrieve Spurius' sheet from the lake, and she was proud of 
               her achievement. She had been forced to dive deeply so she 
               could unhook it from a tree's root.

               To her, it had looked like a bird with its wings flapping 
               toward the shimmering surface, while a snake tried to drag 
               it down into the darkness. Unfortunately, she had ripped the 
               poor creature in her haste to rescue it. The tear and the 
               nasty bloodstains were now concealed within a swan-sized 
               ball, which fitted snuggly under her arm.

               The grown-ups were still pouring out of Decimus' storehouse, 
               shaking their heads, and she smiled at them to see if she 
               could cheer them up a little. However, her smile only seemed 
               to make them shake their heads more heavily.

               "It's a swan," she explained, sliding the sheet behind her.

               "You father is looking for you." Ginnetho was pointing into 
               the woods, and she nodded to thank him for the warning. How 
               could her father have expected her to ask for permission to 
               borrow his tools when he had not been available to ask?  Now 
               he was probably going to chastise her, but she would almost 
               certainly be allowed to borrow the tools anyway. Grown-ups 
               were as silly as chickens, sometimes.

               Azoic's shovel was still in the well, but to her dismay, Azoic had managed to 
               escape. He was nowhere to be seen. If this meant he had given up, after all the 
               trouble she gone to, collecting things for him, then she would be having some very 
               strong words with him. It was a full time job, keeping an eye on Azoic, and she 
               was getting quite tired of it. She threw the ball of material down beside the well, 
               next to the tools and the tent-pole-another item that she gone to great trouble to 
               find- and stamped off toward the trees.

               She no longer smiled at the grown-ups she passed. They had 
               begun to look as serious as lizards, and she knew that when 
               grown-ups looked as serious as lizards, there was no way to 
               cheer them up. Besides, most of them were pointing their 
               lizardlike expressions in her direction, as if everyone knew 
               that she had been raiding village supplies without permission.

               Merab was watching her too, but he was not looking as pleased 
               as he normally would when she was about to get chastised. In 
               fact, he looked unusually concerned about her. She squinted 
               at him, and he immediately looked away, which was not normal 
               for him, either.

               She walked toward him, saying, "That is my sheet, don't you go stealing it while I'm 
               gone." She continued to squint at him, wondering why he was acting so strangely. 
               If he wanted her sheet, he would be looking angrier and sticking his chest out, but 
               instead he was hiding behind the same lizard-like expression that all the grown-
               ups seemed to have. What was going on around here?  She came to a stop in 
               front of him, with her fists on her hips.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        59.


               "So?" She tilted her head to one side and waited.

               "I suppose you want to know where the crazy man is."

               She bit her lip, knowing that any response would delay him.

               "Well, I just might happen know what the crazy man is running 
               away from."

               "I doubt it. You don't know anything." She started turning 
               away, slowly.

               "They frightened him."

               "Who?"

               "Everyone. They were very angry-"

               "What did they say to him?"

               "They didn't say anything, but they found out what he is."

               "Oh, and what is he then?"

               "I don't think I should tell you, it's a really big secret."

               "Were you spying on the meeting?"

               "We didn't have to, they were all shouting as if they wanted 
               us to hear. I can't believe you went swimming when there was 
               so much going on."

               "I was getting some important supplies for building our well, 
               and that is our sheet so you stop looking at it as if you 
               are planning to steal it."

               "You don't have any idea what is going on, do you? If you 
               had only been here, you would have seen everything. It was 
               so funny. The insane man jumped out of his well as if his 
               bottom was on fire, and then he started hopping around, doing 
               his dying wheeze thing, and saying, "mmmust see lake-" Merab's 
               embarrassingly accurate imitation of Azoic was making the 
               story almost believable "-mmmust see nature, mmmmust see my 
               own nose, mmmmust see if my bottom is on fire-"

               "Merab, you just tell me what everybody said, immediately!"

               Her demand only caused Merab to shake his head, and she 
               smacked the hair out of her face, annoyed at having allowed 
               herself to be pulled along by his silly games. "Fine, I will 
               find out eventually, anyway." She started walking away, less 
               slowly this time.

               "If I tell you, can I have the sheet?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        60.


               She spun around, almost shouting, "Yes, take it, just tell 
               me what they said!"

               Merab shrugged. "Oh, they only found out Azoic is an Ixis 
               slave who went around murdering people by setting fire to 
               them." He started making faces, which presumably depicted a 
               person being burned alive. "That was why he is on the run, 
               and hiding from prosecution, here in Summerdale."

               She knew how easily hurt Azoic could be, and she could quite 
               imagine somebody saying something that might upset him, but 
               Merab was obviously just exaggerating to irritate her. Nobody 
               would have been so cruel as to say such a nasty thing to 
               Azoic, would they? "If you think I'm going to give you my 
               sheet for that, you are very mistaken. You are just making 
               up lies to be mean and spiteful. You are jealous because we 
               have a well and you don't.

               You tell me exactly what happened or I'll tell Daddy you 
               were spying on his meeting."  She needed exact details, 
               immediately.

               Unfortunately, instead of being more honest, Merab seemed to 
               become crueler. "Azoic told Father he used to live in Erebus, 
               and he used to go to school there, but Decimus said nobody 
               is allowed to live in Erebus if they go to school. Besides, 
               the insane man is too insane to go to school, and Teacher 
               Berea said he's a Devil-worshipper."

               She forced herself to smile. "Oh, look. Daddy is coming to 
               talk to us, and he's running. Perhaps I should ask him what 
               Teacher Berea really said."

               Merab was backing away, no longer smiling. "Don't you dare, 
               or I'll never be your friend again."

               That was not much of a threat, since he was never friendly 
               anyway, but she had no intention of getting him into trouble.

               "Don't worry, I'm not horrible like you."

               She knew grown-ups rarely ran anywhere, even when they were 
               in a hurry, so she became increasingly concerned about her 
               father's approach. He was breathing heavily, as if he had 
               been running for a long while.

               "Neariah, where have you been? I was looking for you."

               "I was swimming."

               "You were? I looked in the lake, but I didn't-"

               "That's probably because I was under the water, see?" She pointed toward the 
               ball of cloth. "It was all right to borrow it, wasn't it?"  She smiled sweetly at him, 
               hoping his worried expression would not turn to anger.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        61.


               "Oh, I see. Yes, fine, but I thought you were with Azoic. 
               Where is he?"

               "I don't know, I've been looking for him for too."

               Her father began shaking his head slowly. "He is a funny 
               person, isn't he, Possum?  He really doesn't seem to fit in 
               too well around here, does he?"

               She was not at all sure where this was leading, and she gave 
               him a long sideways stare. He laughed at her, then became 
               serious again, all in the same breath. "Why are you looking 
               for Azoic, Daddy?"

               "Ah, I have to, ah.... I have to talk to him. I have to take 
               him to Everdale. Perhaps you would like to come with us?"

               "Can I come too?" Merab was bouncing up and down beside her 
               like a hungry wallaby, which only served to make her father 
               look more confused.

               "No Merab, I'll talk to you in a moment. Can you leave us 
               alone for a while, please."

               She was suddenly feeling afraid, as if something awful was about to happen. She 
               watched silently as Merab stamped away, and she could see he too was fighting 
               back tears, although his were tears of frustration. Could any of what Merab had 
               been saying to her be true? Was her father about to say Azoic was really a bad 
               person? "Why does Azoic have to go to Everdale, Daddy? The well isn't finished."

               "I think...because...it's...how do I explain this?" He was 
               shaking his head and looking at his feet, which was always a 
               bad sign. "Azoic does not belong here, he is different from 
               us.

               He needs to go somewhere, a place where people, like him, go 
               where.... He needs to find a home that-"

               "This is his home." She was pointing at the well, which she 
               realized was a ridiculous place to point, but she could hardly 
               point at Axoic's guest hut since he did not like to stay in 
               it. "He belongs here, with us. He doesn't have anyone else."

               "Yes, but nor do some of the traders-"

               "He's not a trader, he's a... a... a magic person-" Her father 
               had raised his eyebrows, as if this was not acceptable news, 
               so she added, "and he's my best friend."

               She was lifted toward his chest, until she was looking down 
               on his upturned face. Through tear-soaked eyelashes, she 
               could see his frown, and hear the resolution that came with 
               his next words. "Sometimes we have friends who go away."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        62.


               "Like Crazymutt?" she asked, horrified. Was her own father 
               implying that Azoic might never come back again? "Ah, no, 
               not like Crazymutt. Azoic is not going to die, he is just 
               going to go and have a better life somewhere else."

               "But you said he was just going to Everdale-"

               "Where God will help him to continue on his way."

               "That's what you said about Crazymutt, but I wasn't allowed 
               to have a proper burial for him so he might not have gone to 
               Heaven and I don't know how to find out what happened to 
               him, after he died."

               Images of Azoic lost in a daydream kept flashing into her 
               mind, among the images of Crazymutt, not breathing. Sobs 
               were beginning to make it difficult to talk. "Azoic doesn't 
               like the desert, he needs to be here, where I can keep an 
               eye on him, and where he can get his senses back, and build 
               a well, and be close to nature-"

               "Yes, he told me he likes nature, although he doesn't seem 
               to like animals very much."

               "Yes he does."

               "My camel almost frightened the life out of him when we first 
               found him."

               "But that's because your camel has a bad temper. Azoic talks 
               to all kinds of animals, you know. I've seen him do it."

               "Yes, he talks to many things. He is probably in the woods 
               talking to a tree as we speak. That's why he is not like us. 
               He's a stranger."

               "No, he's not." She wrestled her way back to the ground.

               "You don't understand, he's the kindest, nicest, wisest person 
               in the world. You just have to get to know him better, then 
               he won't scare you anymore."

               Decimus was shouting at her father as he approached, causing 
               her father to pat the top of her head as if he wanted her to 
               be quiet-as if she should just become invisible.

               Decimus was smiling. "Azoic seems to be missing. Who was the 
               last to see him? Neariah?"

               "No, she was swimming."

               Neariah bit her lower lip. Yes, she had been swimming when she should have 
               been here to protect Azoic from these mean grown-ups. There was no other 
               explanation, somebody must have said something horrible to him, because Azoic

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        63.


               would not be hiding otherwise. She could certainly imagine Decimus being horrible 
               to Azoic.

               She slipped to the ground and pulled her head out from under 
               her father's hand. She was suddenly running, thinking of 
               places to search. As she swung into Azoic's guest hut, she 
               already knew he would have left the oasis. It was what anyone 
               would do, if they didn't feel welcome anymore. She gasped, 
               feeling suddenly alone, and stared out into the heat-smeared 
               horizon, unable to move onto her next thought.

               "I saw tracks leading off into the desert, from the far side 
               of the oasis." Cabul ran past her, also panting heavily. 
               "The wind is picking up, so the tracks are getting fainter. 
               They head west, maybe he's going back to the city. I climbed 
               a tree, but I couldn't see him. It's hard to see the horizon 
               this time of day, especially with this much sand in the air." 
               Cabul slowed his breathing, but he did not stop talking for 
               long enough to give Neariah a turn to ask any questions. 
               "The crazy man certainly picked a bad time to start walking, 
               but at least he went off by his own free will. It could have 
               been unpleasant otherwise. He might have become violent or 
               something."

               Decimus lifted his sharp nose as if suddenly smelling something. "It is hardly 
               surprising he chose now to run off, is it? He tricked us for as long as he was able, 
               and he would have been risking our disdain if he tried to spin his lies around us 
               any longer." Neariah could see Decimus patting her father's shoulder, as if her 
               father had become his toy, and to Neariah's dismay her father did not appear to 
               be offended.

               She walked toward her father with determination and grabbed 
               his waist. Looking up at him in desperation, she tried to 
               speak as loudly as Decimus. "You can't let Azoic die out 
               there; we have to go and rescue him!"

               "I don't think you will find too many volunteers for that, 
               my dear." Decimus was laughing at her. "Especially since the 
               crazy man will not want to be found. Don't worry about him, 
               Hushah.

               He is not our responsibility anymore, he is his own man. Let 
               him be."

               Neariah pulled at her father's arm, her disbelief turning to horror. "No, Daddy, no!"  
               His smile of regret did little to pacify her and she stared through stinging eyes at 
               the harsh faces surrounding her. "You aren't going to help him are you, any of 
               you? You are all going to leave him out there, aren't you? You are all horrible, 
               horrible people, and I hate all of you!" She threw a long, incriminating glare at her 
               father. "I don't want to live in this horrible village anymore, either!"

               With that she pushed her way through several pairs of legs, 
               using her elbows, and ran toward her bedroom. She was full 
               of a more bitter frustration than she had ever known, and 
               she had said all she ever intended to say to any of them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        64.


               By the time she had slammed her fists into her bed, she had 
               made up her mind about what she was going to do. She was 
               going to rescue Azoic all by herself. When she had found 
               him, she was not going to bring him back to Summerdale. They 
               needed somewhere nicer to live than Summerdale, and anywhere 
               else had to be nicer than living here. Unfortunaely, they 
               were going to have to live somewhere very far away.

               The last time Azoic had needed rescuing, her father had used 
               a camel, but she was not about to ask one of those huge, 
               grumpy beasts if they would mind being ridden. So, she and 
               Azoic were going to have to walk to Erebus, where she felt 
               sure the next stage of her plan would become obvious.

               She pulled her father's wine canister off the shelf, twisted 
               the stopper out of it, emptied its sickly smelling contents 
               onto her mother's polished floor, then refilled it using the 
               water jug on the kitchen table. She did not expect her mother 
               to be too impressed with the mess, or her father to be pleased 
               that she had wasted so much of his wine, but she was in a 
               determined hurry and she did not have time to consider 
               consequences.

               She could see, out of the window, that the grown-ups were 
               now congregating around her sheet, so she was going to have 
               to find a replacement sun-shelter. Her mother's tablecloth 
               was much cleaner, and it would feel softer against her skin.  
               It would also be easier to breathe through, which would be 
               important now that the sand was beginning to fly off the 
               tops of the dunes.

               She packed the tablecloth under her arm, then took a deep 
               breath, trying to think of anything she might have forgetten 
               to collect up.

               No, it was time to go. She could hear everyone arguing, and 
               they did not even look in her direction as she ran into the 
               woods.

               Soon she was alone, and leaving the shade of the trees to 
               push herself into the mid-day's blasting heat.

               Here she was unable to run because it was too tiring in the loose sand. The weight 
               of the water canister was now pressing on her back, forcing her to bend over as 
               she settled into long rhythmic strides.

               She began muttering to herself to keep her mind off the increasing discomfort. 
               Her eyes were stinging, so she decided to keep them closed as much as she could, 
               while also making sure the sun's heat remained on the same side of her face, 
               pushing its presence through her table-cloth. She would soon find Azoic, and then 
               they would reach Erebus, so this discomfort would not last much longer.

               All she had to do was to keep the sun on her left cheek, or 
               was it her right cheek-she always got left and right confused.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        65.


               Anyhow, her father always pointed in this general direction 
               whenever he talked about Erebus, and besides, if Erebus was 
               such a large place then it could hardly be difficult to find.

               There was a nagging worry in the back of her mind, warning 
               her she might be getting lost, but this worry could not 
               compete with the greatest of worries: the image of Azoic 
               dying from thirst before she could save him. She was again 
               obliged to heft her unrelenting load higher up her back, 
               cursing at it through the sheet, but Azoic did not own a 
               water canister of his own.

               This water could mean life, especially if Azoic was already 
               dying of thirst.

               She had lived in the desert all her life, but she had never once been thirsty. Her 
               tongue had now thickened until it could barely be contained inside her mouth. 
               Sand had found its way between her teeth and the feel of hot air in her lungs was 
               sharp enough to make a person cry. She just had to stop and drink.

               She gulped two more times than she had intended, even though 
               the water tasted far less pleasant than she had been 
               imagining. As she resumed her walk, the remaining water 
               splashed around inside the canister. Although lighter, its 
               hollow chugging pressed a warning into her heart, as if it 
               was laughing at her weakness. How much longer would the water 
               last? Without it, she would not be able to revive Azoic.

               Summerdale had become a blister on the horizon, visible only 
               when the wind settled, and then only when she was on top of 
               one of the higher dunes. She had never been this far from 
               the oasis, and it seemed to call her back each time she looked 
               for it. Yet, the memory of those horrible villagers kept her 
               walking away. She resolved not to look back anymore, since 
               doing so only made her feel heavier.

               It was a long time before the afternoon shadows began to creep between the 
               dunes. This allowed her to find shade for her legs, but her arms continued to burn. 
               Her limbs ached through to the bone. Her mind would not stop wandering. Her 
               ankles would carry her into sand troughs that were increasingly difficult to climb 
               out of. The blustering crests offered the only vantage from which to search, so she 
               had no choice but to fight her way back up onto each new crest, one by one.

               For the last while, she had been following her own elongated 
               shadow. It was leading her toward a couple of rocks, which 
               projected up from the sand like the broken ankles of a god-
               like statue. There was no sign of the rest of this god-statue, 
               so she imagined it exploding into dust when the wind had 
               blow it over, scattering the god into the desert.

               Mercifully, she was now making faster progress than she had come to expect. The 
               sand was no longer trying to swallow her alive by sliding out from under her feet. 
               Yet, the god's ankles proved to be much further away than she had estimated, 
               and it took her a long while before she was near enough to wonder why she had 
               aimed for them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        66.


               Then she remembered. She had needed a vantage point. She was 
               going to climb one of them and look around. Despite the 
               equally desperate condition of her own ankles, she had chosen 
               to climb the furthest and largest butte, toward which she 
               once again resumed marching.

               She did not stop to rest when she arrived. Instead, she 
               attacked the shaded side, pushing her fingers and toes into 
               the hot, sandblasted crevices as she looked up at the imposing 
               cliff.

               She had never climbed anything as big as this before. There 
               had only been trees and boulders in the oasis-but those days 
               were history now.

               She gritted her teeth and pulled. There were plenty of deep 
               crevices, which made for good holds, but which might also be 
               the home of evil reptiles. She kept telling herself that any 
               such creatures would be just as scared of her as she was of 
               them, but this did not prevent her from almost falling when 
               she found herself face to face with one of them.

               It was the exact monster she had been imagining. It lay 
               motionless in a jagged notch, looking down upon her fingers 
               as if preparing to bite them off. It was a giant chameleon, 
               and it seemed to be as determined to block her path as she 
               was to resist any retreat.

               She moved her fingers away slowly, staring back at it, knowing 
               that if it attacked, she would have no way to defend herself. 
               Fortunately, it remained motionless, as if it had become 
               part of the crevice it was lying in. It was as red as the 
               rock, as if both had been baked together, and it looked 
               equally ancient and equally lifeless, except for its chameleon 
               eyes, the nearest one of which was flicking over the entire 
               length of her body as if it was still deciding where to bite.

               "Don't you go getting any nasty ideas," she whispered to it.

               This seemed to do the trick, because it started to move away, 
               slowly. "Yes, you are frightened of me, too, aren't you. 
               Don't worry, I won't hurt you."

               As she had often discovered, talking often made things seem 
               less frightening. You only had to imagine what a creature 
               might be feeling, and it would no longer seemed quite so 
               ugly or menacing, although its tired, gray, swollen eye still 
               looked back at her, offering cynicism.

               Meanwhile, its other eye was moving independently, like Azoic's-no, not like 
               Azoic's, his eyes were gentle eyes. This creature's eye pierced her with an 
               unblinking condescension, judging her in a way Azoic's eyes never would. The 
               creature suddenly looked ugly again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        67.


               The chameleon had probably climbed up here to shake off the 
               remaining tatters of its discarded skin. Tiny white sails 
               were curling away from its crusty back and fluttering into 
               the mounting wind, like half-eaten moths. She shuddered and 
               pulled herself away from its malevolent inspection. Again, 
               she had become so distracted by her thoughts that she had 
               forgotten what she was doing. This, the top of the world, 
               was a dangerous place to lose one's concentration.

               At last she reached the relative safety of the butte's tabletop, although the end of 
               her climb came as a relief, not as cause for celebration. The giant structure on 
               which she knelt, panting at the heat which radiating up from it, was covered with 
               rusty shards that chewed her bloody knees. She eventually managed to create a 
               protective seat for herself out of her mother's once clean-but now shredded-
               tablecloth.

               She smeared blood over her legs when she rubbed them, and 
               she shivering despite the warmth in the wind that was 
               whistling past her. She was tired, hungry, aching-especially 
               her feet- and thirsty! So very thirsty that she dared not 
               even think about her water canister, in case her will to 
               save it for Azoic should be overcome.

               Azoic was nowhere to be seen, and to her surprise, nor was 
               Summerdale or Erebus. She must have picked the wrong 
               direction, and only now could she see how many wrong 
               directions there could be. The world had grown much larger, 
               and she was feeling ever smaller in its menacing scope. She 
               stared out at the endlessness from her vantage point, and 
               tried not to cry.

               Her thoughts returned to Summerdale, where she ought to be sitting on her cozy 
               bed, drinking cold mango juice and listening to her mother cooking. Her mother 
               did not like her to play out in the desert-what would she say if she knew how far 
               the desert went on for, and how far she had walked?  There was a little pride mixed 
               with her anxiety, but no matter how much she had achieved, she knew she would 
               be in deep trouble if she ever returned home. This was the first time she had ever 
               done anything she knew her parents would be furious about, but-to her knowledge-
               it was also the first time her father had been completely wrong.

               Would she ever see them again? There they would be, long 
               after she was dead, sitting down eating her favorite soup 
               for dinner, complaining about what a bad daughter she had 
               been....

               Yet, they seemed happy enough to go on with their lives without her. Again, she 
               remembered their harsh faces, and again she remembered Decimus' hand on her 
               father's shoulder. There was that look of pity from her father when she was begging 
               him for help, and Decimus was laughing because he wanted Azoic to die.

               Yes, Decimus had tricked her father into hating Azoic! Poor old Azoic could not 
               look after himself. He could not even see properly. Nobody had given Azoic a 
               chance, yet he had always been so nice to everyone. He had even built half a 
               well for them, but nobody had appreciated it. Nobody had tried to help him, and he 
               had worked so hard, especially for a sick person, and he had talked to her when

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        68.


               nobody else had wanted to talk to her, and he was her best friend and she trusted 
               him even if nobody else did.

               Tears were demanding a presence in her eyes, but she would 
               not let them get in her way. "Why do people get so nasty 
               when they are afraid?" She turned her complaints toward the 
               fattening sun, and almost blinded herself with its powerful 
               light. "Why doesn't anyone care?"  She clenched her fists 
               defiantly and blew grit from her dry lips. "It's that 
               Duckface's fault! He doesn't trust anyone. Just because Azoic 
               is wiser than Duckface!  Old Duckface thinks he's a proper 
               Elder, but we know what Mommy calls him behind his back." 
               She put her hand over her mouth and listened to the moaning 
               wind, pretending it was translating the sun's response to 
               her.

               "Yes, and you heard what Mommy told Teacher Berea.

               Decimus is only the Elder because he's the oldest, and not 
               because he is God's best friend. So now perhaps Azoic is the 
               oldest, and the wisest, and I very much doubt God and Decimus 
               were ever friends in the first place. So, that's why Duckface 
               is being so mean to Azoic, you see?" She was relieved that 
               the sun saw, because she did not quite understand how else 
               to explain the point she was trying to make.

               Above her, the sickly-gray sky was filling up with bulging 
               clouds, which were piling rudely into each other. A fierce 
               gale appeared to be blowing away half of the horizon. It was 
               wrestling clouds of sand up into the sky to make the darkness 
               look more miserable than it already was. It was obviously 
               not going to be a nice night to be left out in the dessert, 
               and she began to realize how deeply afraid she was of dying.

               However, she was not about to let self-pity distract her 
               from the job she had set for herself. She smacked at her 
               hair, and carefully stepped over the treacherous shards of 
               rock. Turning to view a vast nothingness, she stretched her 
               raw gaze across a shimmering purple haze that had once been 
               the blue horizon.

               "Where are you, Azoic?" She continued to turn, sliding her feet through rasping 
               scales. "I can't see Summerdale anymore, but I'm sure it can't be far away. If I 
               just keep looking...." The talking game was necessary to avoid thinking about her 
               thirst, but she aught to be talking about Azoic, not about Summerdale.

               "Yes, and Azoic can't be too far away, either, can he?"

               Having got used to her slow spin, her body seemed to want to continue the motion, 
               even though it was making her feel sick. It occurred to her, as she tried to keep 
               herself upright, that she was in serious danger of cutting her feet, and perhaps 
               falling to her death over the edge of the rock. Yet, the world seemed content to 
               continue revolving around her, and the horizon had become an endless smear, 
               punctuated by a fat orange spot that made her squint every time it rushed past 
               her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        69.


               She was very much aware of the orange spot's intention to 
               sneak away from sight. It was setting, and soon it would 
               leave her alone in the dark with nothing to talk to. "Do you 
               know where Azoic is, Mr. Sun?" She reconsidered her words.

               "Yes, of course you know where he is, you and God can see 
               everything, can't you. I bet you even know where Azoic came 
               from. If you could only speak for yourself, I bet you could 
               ask God if he could forgive Azoic. Although, I still can't 
               imagine Azoic doing anything that needs to be forgiven. 
               Perhaps God needs to forgive everyone else for not being 
               like Azoic. That wouldn't be too much to ask, would it?"

               She checked her spinning and stared at the sun in shock as 
               it said, "Such faith in me."

               Her eyes filled with powerful orange light as she began to 
               recognize the wheezing voice. Then the world lurched as it 
               started itself spinning again, allowing her to catch only a 
               few more words.

               "You are falling...!"

               

               Hushah was pushing his fingers into the soft patch in his wife's kitchen floor. The 
               polished animal-dung cement was only vulnerable to water if left to soak, and the 
               insertion depth of his fingers indicated water had been soaking into it for quite a 
               while. Moserah was holding an empty water jug and staring at him in stunned 
               silence. He had just told his wife to shut up, something he had never done before, 
               but he had not meant to sound so angry-he had just needed time to think.

               A wine canister was missing, as was the tablecloth, and the 
               water jug was empty. He should have guessed Neariah would 
               try something dramatic like this, but he was still uncertain 
               whether she was out in the desert. There was still the 
               possibility she was hiding in the woods so everyone would 
               search the desert for her, and thus for Azoic....

               No, such an idea was too devious, and besides, she would 
               feel the need to find Azoic herself. She would have convinced 
               herself that nobody would care if she dissappeared, and with 
               her determined strides she could be a long way out by now.

               "Tell everyone in the village that Neariah is searching for the insane...for Azoic."  
               He looked up at his wife's desperate expression, then stood up to hold her. "Don't 
               worry, we will find her, but we must get everyone involved just to make sure that-" 
               she does not disappear forever?  "-she returns before she gets sun-burned. Now, 
               don't worry, she can't have gone very far. Where did we put Spurius' horse?"

               "Under the trees, behind Decimus' house, but it isn't healthy 
               enough for-"

               "The camels are slow. I haven't got much choice, but I'm 
               sure this won't take long. The horse will be fine."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        70.


               There were several water sacks in the storehouse. As he ran 
               he shouted instructions toward any villager who came within 
               earshot. He doubted any of them heard a full sentence, but 
               he could not let himself stop and look at them directly. His 
               head ached from the confusion he was trying to contain, and 
               a blinding hostility was surging inside him, which he might 
               not be able to restrain if he tried to be polite. It was 
               better to let Moserah organize everyone; he needed to be 
               riding.

               The horse obviously realized how frustrated he was, because 
               it did not resist when he started to gallop. Unfortunately, 
               its respect evaporated when they neared the lake. He had to 
               dismount and push it away from the water with his shoulder.

               The animal would be more difficult to ride if he let it drink.

               Besides, it was already overfilled with water from its last 
               visit to the lake, carrying Spurius. Moserah was right about 
               the horse's poor health. It would not take much to push his 
               mount beyond its limits, forcing him to walk with it.

               It grunted and pulled at the tree to which he tied it, while he submerged the water 
               sacks and waited impatiently for them to fill up. Eventually, he tied the sacks to 
               the saddle and pulled the unfortunate beast until it was far enough from the lake 
               to be mounted without losing control. He then kicked it onward with more force 
               than was neccessary, sending the frightened animal into another perilous gallop 
               through whipping branches, and out into the waiting desert.

               Only in the desert could the true size of the sky be viewed, 
               and only in the desert did time seem to slow down long enough 
               to allow one to view it. Here, there was only sand and sky, 
               and more sand and sky, and of course, the blinding sun!  No 
               matter how many times he rode into the desert, and no matter 
               how preoccupied he might be with other concerns, the desert 
               never failed to remind him of how mortal he was. However, 
               this was the first time it had ever threatened to take away 
               his child.

               It was not long before the horse was beginning to falter, and the threat of it giving 
               up and dumping him into the sand had become strangely irritating. He only needed 
               it to last last long enough to find Neariah; she would still be walking out there, and 
               she had probably been walking all afternoon.

               What a disgusting father he was, an adult who had lived in the desert all his life, 
               but who had never taught his own child how to travel through it. How had he let 
               this happen?  He should have expected her to go searching for Azoic, because 
               she was not the weak person he was. He should have gone searching for Azoic 
               himself; but he had been too absorbed by his own need to make life simple again. 
               Yes, he had to admit to himself, he was a simple man and he needed a simple life.

               Unexpected challenges filled him with fear and confusion. He 
               was not like his daughter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        71.


               Neariah jumped upon challenges with wide eyes, as if she was 
               gorging herself on honey, and it was her natural heroism 
               that made him so proud of her. That she could be so small, 
               and that the desert could be so big, yet she would risk her 
               own life for what she believed in.

               It had not mattered to her that the wind would make finding 
               Azoic almost impossible; she would not be thinking of failure.

               She would have decided to walk through this eternal heat 
               because she did not share her father's fear of doing the 
               right thing, alone. Her father was a coward, a coward who 
               had much to learn from his daughter.

               Yet, Decimus had been right about one thing, they did not 
               have the right to force Azoic to live in Summerdale. Besides, 
               Azoic's presence was not something he alone could force upon 
               the other villagers. There was no way to guess what risks he 
               had already exposed them to by bringing the man into the 
               village, and they could indeed suffer if the Ixis found an 
               arsonist among them.

               So, was not the answer to relocate Azoic to somewhere safer and more welcoming, 
               somewhere Azoic could fully recover his memory and prove his innocence? He 
               could imagine how ridiculous it would sound to Neariah, as if there could be 
               anywhere safer than Summerdale, but by keeping Azoic nobody was safe. There 
               was nowhere to hide him if the Ixis arrived.

               Unless the children had some suggestions about hiding him.

               Neariah had recently managed to hide from him under water, 
               but it was too much to hope that Azoic might share her skills 
               at swimming. Short of burying himself in his well, it was 
               beginning to look as if Azoic could not possibly avoid....

               "That's it!" The horse had turned its head to watch him 
               suspiciously, so he was looking it in the eye. "If we finished 
               that well, we could hide him down there! I could even make a 
               cave, and conceal it by putting rocks around the...."

               He realized he was gesturing at the horse as if he needed 
               its approval. He frowned at it.

               "So, it might be a wild idea, but even if it does not work it could buy us more time 
               to solve this dilemma."  If he could only persuade the other villagers to let him finish 
               the well, before they banished the poor fellow, he might then be able to figure out 
               a way to persuade them it was safe to keep the man.

               He pulled at the reins and the horse came to an abrupt halt, 
               sighing loudly and shaking its head. He stood up on the 
               saddle, which wobbled on the horse's thin backbone. Aside 
               from allowing him to search the horizon, this would also 
               help any followers to notice him. He would appear to them to 
               be little more than a dark needle, poking out from the folding 
               heatshimmers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        72.


               The encroaching night would normally clean the air, but this 
               evening was not normal, visibility was not good and the 
               weather was getting worse.

               From his higher vantage he could see a long procession of 
               dark shadows crawling across the desert, and it was not long 
               before he could hear their vehement rasp. They brought huge 
               walls of rain, a dense fog forming colossal curtains, and 
               they were drawing closer. He almost lost his footing as the 
               cold smell of dampness hit his face. The air was suddenly 
               heavy.

               He dropped down into the saddle and tried to urge the horse 
               on again. The horse moved heavily despite his kicks, so he 
               dismounted and poured water onto its muzzle, hoping to 
               motivate the sorry-looking creature. Eventually it began to 
               walk again, and he leaned his shoulder against its leeward 
               side, becoming angrier with himself for not having used one 
               of the camels. He should have found Neariah by now.

               Darkness was descending fast, and he had not seen any of the 
               other villagers following him. Then some smaller shadows 
               seemed to dance, out in the distance. He looked again, trying 
               to discern who the collection of dark shapes might be. He 
               turned the horse toward them, but it seemed like ages before 
               he received any reply to his shouts. The voice he heard was 
               not one he recognized.

               "Who is...." The voice was consumed by a sudden howl of wind, 
               until it again punched through with more urgency. "...and 
               where did you come from?"  The dark shapes seemed to resolve 
               themselves into men, just as another blast of sand caught 
               him in the face and forced him to rub his eyes. When he was 
               again able to see, the closest man had become a large 
               individual who was running toward him with a bounding gait.

               The large man came to a stop and leaned forward, his hands 
               resting on his knees. "We are lost. Can you help us?"

               "Are you traders?"

               "Yeah, traders, and you? Where did you come from?"

               "I, ah-" Hushah halted his own gesture just in time to turn 
               it into a shoulder rub instead of a point. "Quite far!"  He 
               coughed several times as he squinted toward the other men 
               who were still approaching. There were at least two more of 
               them. The nearest one was leaning against a mule with a wagon.

               The stranger standing in front of him was by far the largest, although the way he 
               stooped almost brought him down to Hushah's own height. He was rounded in his 
               facial features, rounded at his waist and he had rounded shoulders. It seemed as 
               if the softer parts of his body had outgrown the bones

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        73.


               they surrounded. Even the stranger's hands were rounded, making his fingers 
               look like thick stubs.

               He was either borrowing someone elses clothes or he had 
               outgrown his own. His garments looked expensive, perhaps 
               even elegant in better circumstances. In fact, all of these 
               strangers were wearing elegant yet ill-fitting clothes. They 
               were very inappropriately dressed for desert travel, yet 
               each had a thick shock of stubble, which hinted at many days 
               of such travel.

               The big, rounded man stepped past him and smacked at the 
               rump of the listless horse. The horse hardly moved. "An Ixis 
               horse, but you have not taken good care of it, have you?"

               Hushah could see that the man was brushing dust off the 
               animal's brand, and he cursed himself for allowing the man 
               to approach so close. "Ah, yes. It wandered here, by itself-
               "

               "A smart horse. Where is here?"

               "Here? Oh, I... Nowhere, we are far way from anywhere."

               Hushah could tell he was not sounding too convincing.

               "You must be from Summerdale, right? The first oasis on the 
               Erebic Trade Route, right?"

               "Could be." Could he convince them to bypass Summerdale? 
               "Take us."  The request was neither courteous nor negotiable; 
               the stranger was already pulling at the horse's halter.

               "But I'm not going that way. I'm-"

               The man stepped backward and grabbed Hushah's tunic. "In case you haven't 
               noticed, there is a storm coming in, and if we don't reach Summerdale soon we 
               are likely to get buried by it.

               Where else could you possibly need to go?"

               Hushah pulled away. "My daughter-" again he stopped himself, 
               he needed to think.

               The man smiled, and the grip on his tunic relaxed, "Oh, you 
               lost your daughter. Let me guess. She was on the horse, and 
               when you turned around she was gone."

               Hushah nodded and made a grab at the horse's halter. "I have 
               to go."

               "This animal doesn't have much left in it. If you were on 
               your way to Summerdale when you lost her, maybe she found 
               her way there on her own. How old is the girl?  How long ago 
               did you lose her?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        74.


               "She is young, and it was mid-day when she-"

               "Then we have to leave her for a while. You won't find her 
               during this storm. Besides, we have to find out where the 
               hell we are before we can possibly find anyone else."

               The man with the wagon had pulled the mule up beside them.

               "Who is this, Lucius?"

               "He is a trader, like us."

               The other man exposed black teeth. "Like who?"

               "No, Gnaeus, you aren't listening. I said he is a trader, 
               like we are traders, understand? He is looking for his 
               daughter. He has lost her."

               "Oh, that's a terrible shame. Does he know anything about 
               that god-damned oasis?"

               Both of the men were now staring at him, but he was not sure 
               what he ought to say or do. Their wagon was chaotically piled, 
               not loaded, and it contained items he had never seen traders 
               carrying before, including gold goblets and cutlery.

               Yet, it was the weapons, forming a pile of their own, which 
               continued to draw his attention. There were far more weapons 
               than a few traders could possibly need, even if they were 
               out to do mischief. Weapons were not part of village life, 
               and it was these weapons which Hushah tried unsuccessfully 
               to ignore as he started to question the men, "Weap-ah, what 
               kind of traders are you? What do you trade? How many are 
               there of you?"

               The large stranger looked back over his shoulder and nodded.

               "Oh, the weapons. They are part of a special shipment we 
               purchased a while ago."

               The black-toothed man found this amusing. "Yeah, and they 
               were horrible expensive, weren't they, Lucius?"

               Lucius' face swung around and seemed to shock the smaller 
               man into silence. "Shut your mouth, Gnaeus!"

               A third stranger halted several paces away, as if Lucius' 
               shout had also reached him, but he looked no less intimidating 
               than Lucius. Hushah was becoming increasingly uncomfortable 
               about these individuals. They did not seem to treat each 
               other as friends, and they were mean-spirited.

               Hushah was torn by indecision. Should he try to lead these men away from the 
               village, and from where ever Neariah might be? Should he ask them to help him 
               search for her?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        75.


               He needed to go back to Summerdale to get a camel, but he did not want to break 
               off his search, leaving Neariah to wander further away.

               He did not know what he should do, but he did know these men 
               had weapons, and there were at least three of them, and the 
               largest one now had a firm control of his horse.

               He was worse than a bad father, he was a weak man, and it 
               seemed he was going to bring even more harm into Summerdale.

               He suddenly understood why he felt so angry all the time; he 
               was disgusted with himself.

               

               The wind was pushing at their backs as Hushah followed the strangers into the 
               village, but Hushah was no less shocked than they were. He had not expected 
               everyone in the village to have left in search of Neariah, and he felt humbled for 
               having been so angry with everyone. They were his own people, after all, no matter 
               what harm he might bring upon them. They cared about his family as much as he 
               did, but surely they had not allowed their own children to join the search as well? 
               "Is this all there is?"  Gnaeus had picked a spear out of the wagon and was 
               bouncing it in his palm as he walked. "Must've left in a hurry, huh? They probably 
               ran away when they saw us coming, huh, Lucius?"

               Apart from the wind-wrenched noises of creaking wood and the 
               occasional snap of doors banging shut, the village was silent.

               Lucius grunted, possibly in agreement, but he continued to 
               look around as if he expected someone to jump out and surprise 
               them. Hushah was tempted to tell them there was nothing to 
               worry about, but he too remained silent.

               "An empty village. You're so clever, Lucey. You could sell 
               snow in Hell." Gnaeus stroked his spear and sighed.

               "How many times do I have to tell you to shut your-" Lucius stopped speaking 
               suddenly. He was staring at the paint around the door of Decimus' house as if he 
               found Jaalam's artwork distasteful. He spelled out the large gold letters. "B, A, N, 
               K. Is that thing a bank? These people have a bank in an oasis?"  He glanced back 
               at Hushah, suddenly smiling. "That must be a joke, right?"

               "Oh, look. There are guest huts, over there." Hushah tried 
               to redirect them away from Decimus' house, walking sideways 
               so he would not have to turn his back on them.

               "Guest huts? How would you know they are guest huts if you 
               do not live here?" Lucius smiled and continued walking toward 
               Decimus' house.

               Hushah shouted after him, "I just don't think they will like 
               you going in there when they are not around."

               Lucius ignored him. "Gnaeus, put our stuff inside this bank.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        76.


               Servius, tie up the mule and put a sack over its head."

               Hushah resigned himself to letting the men do as they pleased 
               until Decimus and the others returned. He felt confident 
               that when they did return, these "traders" would soon find 
               some manners. Decimus did not even let his own villagers go 
               into his home uninvited.

               He moved closer to the strangers' wagon, and pretended to 
               tie Spurius' horse to it. As he did so, he watched the third 
               man, Servius, uncover even more weapons. Some of these weapons 
               were coated with dried blood.

               Hushah backed away as Servius stepped toward him. It was the 
               first time he had seen the man's face, and its many scars.

               "Keep out of the way." Servius' squint left no room for doubt 
               that failure to obey was not recommended. So, Hushah kept 
               out of the way while Servius returned to the wagon to pull 
               up a handful of weapons, along with several other dubious 
               possessions, and carry them into the storehouse.

               "Hushah? Did you see Neariah?"

               Hushah turned to see Berea emerging from his own home, 
               followed by a line of excited children.

               "No, no." He motioned them all to back away, but Berea just 
               kept marching toward the strangers as if she intended to 
               physically restrain them herself.

               Several crashing sounds came from inside the storehouse, and 
               Berea pushed a finger into his chest. "Who are these people?" 
               she demanded.

               "Please, Berea." Hushah tried to restrain her before she 
               reached the storehouse's steps, but she was worth his own 
               weight plus that of a horse.

               Yet, instead of climbing the steps, she stepped backward and 
               bounced heavily onto his chest like a mountain of sourdough.

               The beginnings of her slow collapse came as a complete 
               surprise to Hushah, and he struggled helplessly as her large 
               body overwhelmed him.

               It was Lucius who pulled her off him and carried her into 
               the Sabbath-house. When he returned he was laughing. "Ah, my 
               man Servius is sorry. I'm sure he didn't mean to hit your 
               wife, but she must have surprised him. It's a nervous reaction 
               he has, that's all. It's nothing to get upset about. I'm 
               sure he will apologize directly to your good lady when she 
               comes around.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        77.


               Anyhow, we don't have time to be polite at the moment, 
               especially if we are going to help you find your missing 
               kid."

               "No, it's fine. I don't need your help-"

               "Sure you do."

               "What? Sure they do?" Gnaeus stepped out onto the storehouse 
               steps. "We aren't going to go back out there again, are we 
               Lucius? We only just got-"

               Lucius' large hand wrapped around Gnaeus' jaw and pushed the 
               small man back up the steps, and Servius reached out from 
               within the storehouse to grab Gnaeus by the neck and pull 
               him back inside. Gnaes was thus lifted bodily, and the sounds 
               that followed could have been those of a fist hitting flesh.

               Lucius did not look around as these sounds continued, instead 
               he continued to speak as if he had not even been interrupted.

               "Don't worry about the mess. I will make sure your little 
               hut gets tidied up, and we will pay for all the takings. You 
               don't mind, do you?"

               Hushah frowned. "What takings?"

               "You should get those children somewhere safe."

               Hushah looked behind him to see Merab and the other children 
               standing close together. He quickly herded them into the 
               Sabbath-house, into which the wind was now blowing showers 
               of sand. He instructed them to tie down the window thatches, 
               to light lanterns, to distribute reading books and to sweep 
               the floor. Anything to keep everyone busy.

               Merab was the least cooperative. He seemed to be deeply wounded when told to 
               sweep, and then refused to take part in any other activity. Instead, he threatened 
               to run out and join the adventure, as he had taken to calling it. Hushah was not 
               inclined to explain how serious his sister's predicament really was, so he let Merab 
               sulk. Merab obligingly remained standing in his corner with his back to everyone, 
               kicking at walls and stamping on floorboards.

               The unconscious Berea suddenly sat up and rubbed her chin.

               She nodded slowly as Hushah tried to explain what had just 
               happened to her, then she waved him away with instructions 
               to go and keep an eye on the strangers. As he ran out, he 
               could see a row of little eyes, framed by fingers, poking 
               out through the Sabbath-house's window thatches.

               He wondered how long Berea would be able to keep those little fingers busy before 
               their owners again became unmanageable. He was also worried about leaving 
               them in the village, alone

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        78.


               with the strangers, but he had no choice. He had to attend to greater worries.

               As he again leaned into the wind, the promised rain started 
               to fall upon him, building quickly into a roar that pounded 
               on his scalp, while turning the sand into tiny jerking 
               craters. The desert now lifted an infinite number of miniature 
               maws, each seething in agony. Drenched, he reeled in air, 
               which felt too thin to breathe. The rain landed in such heavy 
               waves that he writhed as if his back was being beaten with a 
               plank.

               Then the rain became sharply solid; a dreadful hiss, pellets 
               drilling into the frenzied sand. He had never seen solid 
               water before, but he had heard about it from the traders. 
               Also, he had never seen puddles forming in sand.

               He pulled up an empty box he found, floating in one of the 
               puddles, and as he lifted it over his head the solid rain 
               began to shake it as if he was deflecting shovel-loads of 
               gravel.

               His hands were already numb, so he would not be able to hold 
               the box up much longer. The stinging pellets were now coming 
               at him from all directions, so the box offered little 
               protection anyway, and he gave up the struggle to prevent 
               the wind from ripping it out of his grasp.

               For a moment the rain abated, and a chill descended upon the 
               village. He shivered as he began to pray, awkwardly at first; 
               he was guilty of giving lip-service during Decimus' weekly 
               Sabbath-house gatherings, but now he so desperately needed 
               to be heard, he needed to make amends for whatever he had 
               done to bring this punishment upon everyone.

               It was he who should be punished, not the villagers, and especially not Neariah; 
               surely God could see that? He begged God to let him find his lost child and bring 
               her home. He could not believe that God would let his child be taken away like 
               this. She done nothing to harm anyone; she was as innocent as anyone could be; 
               it was not fair that God should cause such harm, so indiscriminately.

               Decimus was before him, crawling and cowering as if he was 
               suffering great agony. "God has damned us because of your 
               daughter, Hushah. God has damned us because He did not want 
               us to go out there, searching for that insane man-"

               "Decimus, what are you saying? Did you see Neariah?"

               "Oh, Hushah, I can hardly see. Am I going blind? I think my 
               bones are broken. You have to help me!"

               "You are fine, this is rain, it won't kill you. The storehouse 
               is directly ahead of you." Hushah picked him up and pushed.

               "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you." Decimus began to stagger away, picking 
               up speed as he went, and Hushah shook

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        79.


               his head. At least there would now be another villager to help protect the children, 
               assuming Decimus could overcome his present distress and actually think of anyone 
               but himself.

               He passed several other villagers on his way out into the 
               desert, but none of them seemed to be able to give him any 
               useful information about Neariah. Some of them even tried to 
               persuade him to return with them, but instead he pulled away, 
               charging further out into the fists of the gale.

               He was going to find his daughter if he died trying, and 
               dying was probably exactly what he deserved.

               

               Merab had never seen his father in such an unfriendly mood, 
               and he most certainly did not appreciate being treated so 
               harshly in front of all the other children. The excitement 
               the strangers were causing had lost much of its appeal since 
               he had been so unfairly victimized, and it was not until he 
               realized his father had really left the Sabbath-house that 
               he felt ready to discontinue his sulking.

               "I can count twenty people and fourteen chickens." John's 
               claims were far greater than those of the other children, 
               but there was no way to tell whether John was telling the 
               truth; John was a well-known lier.

               Merab pushed his fingers through the window thatch to gain his own vantage point. 
               There were a lot of grown-ups running around outside. Some were trying to nail 
               boards onto the pigpen, while others were making futile attempts to rescue 
               possessions stolen by the wind.

               Several people, including the three new traders, were struggling to tie down the 
               trader's wagon, while another group was holding on to the remains of the chicken 
               coop. The whole coop had rolled over, onto its side, and it was hurling chickens 
               out into the gloom before they had time to screech in surprise.

               "Chicken Fifteen!" John shouted. "Did you see that one? It 
               was bouncing like a ball!"

               It was a challenge to tell who was who, out there among the 
               confusion. Many must remain missing, names were still being 
               called, but since nobody came near the Sabbath-house there 
               was a shortage of news. They were so close to the adventure, 
               yet they were trapped in this prison. Teacher Berea's fat 
               legs lay across the doorway, blocking all hope of escape.

               Ginnetho was standing outside, hugging his own shoulders.

               He was close enough to call out to. "Ginnetho, look up here.

               Ginnetho, where did my father go?"

               Merab had not expected a reply, but he did achieve a wave.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        80.


               Then Ginnetho curled up shoulder-to-shoulder with Jaalam, as 
               if they were both trying to make themselves smaller. They 
               looked like they were shouting at each other, then together 
               they staggered into the Sabbath-house.

               Again Merab's questions were ignored as Ginnetho and Jaalam 
               spoke with Teacher Berea. The Teacher's chair took up an 
               entire corner of the Sabbath-house, opposite the doorway, so 
               as they lifted her into it, the three grown-ups all had their 
               backs to Merab's escape route.

               This was his chance, but as he began to slide cautiously 
               toward the door, the big trader burst in and pushed him 
               backward.

               Decimus, Cabul, and several of the other children's parents 
               followed, each piling into the back of the other.

               This made the Sabbath-house suddenly crowded, so he decided 
               to postpone his escape for a few moments while he listened 
               to what everyone might have to say. Besides, the big trader 
               was obviously not someone who liked children, and his huge 
               arm remained too close for comfort.

               "I think everyone is back, except Hushah, Moserah and Neariah!"  All sign of 
               Jaalam's usual shyness seemed to have vanished, even though fervent faces 
               were surrounding him, all shouting at once. Merab had never seen Jaalam look 
               people in the eye before, and there was no stuttering as he shouted.

               Visibility, out there in the darkness, seemed to be the issue 
               that needed to be discussed at the greatest volume, and it 
               was an issue that seemed likely to postpone the search for 
               Neariah until daylight. At such time, they all concluded, 
               the wind would die, but his sister would none-the-less remain 
               alive.

               Merab had not considered the possibility that anyone would 
               die in this adventure, so he was quite disatisfied with 
               everyone's conclusions. They could not possibly leave his 
               sister out there in this storm all night. He wondered what 
               his sister would do if it was he who had become lost instead 
               of her. It was a new kind of thought for him, but he knew 
               the answer immediately.

               Certainly, she would not abandon him. Yet, he was not quite 
               as ready to start shouting at so many serious looking adults 
               as she would have been, had she been here. He had always 
               known he was not quite as brave as his sister, and now he 
               knew why bravery was so important.

               Never before had he explicitly acknowledged that her strange temperament 
               contained bravery, but then it was so difficult to talk of girls being brave. She would 
               make such a good warrior, if she were not a girl. She also had the potential to be 
               a great Warlord, were she a boy. Of course, Warlord

                                                                        81.


               would be the only rank fit for her, because she would probably never learn how to 
               obey orders.

               "Mr. Decimus, what else can we do?" It was the big trader, 
               hugging Decimus' arm as if the two of them had become close 
               friends. "We need to wait, and you should rest, Mr. Decimus, 
               you have to save yourself for tomorrow."

               "Yes, yes." Decimus had draped himself over John's bench and 
               was resting his forehead on John's desk. He was also gasping 
               for breath and moaning, faintly.

               "My pigs could be gone forever." Cabul had been one of the 
               first to return from the search, and Merab suspected he would 
               be one of the last to resume it.

               The big trader now had his hand on Cabul's arm and he was 
               patting Cabul gently. "Oh, don't you worry, Mr. Cabul. We 
               will buy you some more."

               This seemed to cheer Cabul up greatly, and he winked at Merab 
               as if he was impressed by the big trader's ridiculous promise. 
               Merab shook his head and busied himself elsewhere.

               Through the thatch he could see more parents running toward the Sabbath-house 
               to comfort their children. These children were standing beside him looking quite 
               useless, children who had only just begun to wail as if, with the arrival of their 
               parents, they had just realized that bad things were happening.

               His mother was not among those running and he began to worry whether she too 
               had gone missing. Could the desert be stealing away his entire family? Why were 
               none of the other families doing anything?  He looked back to see why the adults 
               were so quiet. They were all watching him as if they had just been talking about 
               him. He shook away the feelings he knew his face was betraying, and pushed his 
               gaze back through the thatch. He did not want to show them his fear-unlike the 
               other children. So, he stared out into the gloom, determined to ignore the 
               commotion going on behind him.

               A door seemed to lurch and fall to the ground, as if someone 
               inside had shouldered into it. A breadbasket was then kicked 
               out over this door to spill bread-rolls into the puddles. 
               These rolls skated into the puddles until they were splattered 
               to pieces, as if by an invisible club. His once familiar 
               home had become a supernatural mad-house, and he was convinced 
               there were hysterical demons in it, wreaking vengeance.

               The window flaps of everybody else's homes were also bursting 
               open and jumping off their hinges. He could hear the contents 
               of their homes rattling and banging, despite the incessant 
               wailing of the wind. A washbowl jerked upward through the 
               tattered roof of John's hut, and then careened into the 
               arching treetops.

               The trees were bent over, grinding with pain. Beyond their tortured limbs, webs of 
               intricate fibers almost flickered at

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        82.


               the edge of existence, in air that flashed silver. He shook his head firmly. Was his 
               own imagination getting the better of him?  Again he stared up at the shattered 
               sky, where the silver mist was cracking, reforming, splitting, and tearing at its own 
               fibers.

               Brilliantly veined ghost-hands were ripping it, and crushing it, with sharp white claws. 
               The fingers connected with giant skeletons of light, and elsewhere, even greater 
               giants were steadily hammering on immense drums; summoning up a rolling 
               explosion that was already causing the ground to shake in fearful anticipation.

               The whining wind reminded him of his sister's puppy-when the stupid thing had 
               been busy dying. It was not a pleasant memory; he had even cried a little himself; 
               of course, he would never admit such a thing to any one. Besides, everyone had 
               been too busy consoling Neariah to notice whether he might also be upset. She 
               had cried enough for both of them, and now she was probably out there in this 
               evil storm, crying some more.

               "We are damned, we will all die!" Decimus was making a whining 
               sound of his own.

               Merab continued to ignore him. Each lightning flash lit up the village, providing an 
               opportunity to scan a scene that looked hard and unnatural. After each flash he 
               was left blinking into an eye-numbing darkness, wondering whether he had really 
               seen someone out there in the broken gloom.

               "Look!" Merab waved frantically to attract everyone's 
               attention, but the shadowless object he was still staring 
               toward had disappeared.

               "What is it, Merab?" Ginnetho stood behind him.

               A splintering quill of brilliance seemed to reach in through the window thatch, and 
               he backed away. Either side of him, children jumped into the arms of silver-faced 
               parents, then screamed as the flashing light made everyone look like flames 
               flickering out. Then an almost constant sheet of frenzy suspended the tattered 
               fabric of their world, forcing all who moved to jerk like frightened birds.

               "I thought I saw something, over there by the lantern!" 
               Azoic's lantern was still burning, flickering feebly in its 
               own swirling mist. It was leaning precariously in a pool of 
               shallow water, which was chopping at its base.

               "Yes, Merab, I see it. You tell me when it goes out."

               Merab felt Ginnettho's hand on his head. "No, Ginnetho, there 
               was something out there."  Then he realized the puddle was 
               Azoic's water-filled well and the lantern was the same one 
               that rested on what remained of the well's sand-ridge. This 
               meant that the water beside the lantern could be deep, as 
               deep as the well, and his father could be in it.

               Ginnetho was pressing the thatch and saying, "We have to 
               wait for a while, until the storm passes. Then we can go out 
               and search some more. Don't worry, your sister is-"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        83.


               Merab did not wait to hear the rest of the sentence. He was 
               already sliding past the big trader, charging out into the 
               gale.

               As he leaped onto a soggy island of shivering sand, a roar 
               opened up the sky above him, exploding the air and shaking 
               his bones, causing him to slip into deeper water. He did not 
               look up toward the sky to see what was might be chasing him; 
               he was frightened enough already. Instead, he scooped forward, 
               using each flash of light to plan his next step.

               Leaves and branches from the woods scuttled into him, as if 
               they too were fleeing the unseen evil surrounding them. The 
               rain attacked like a swarm of bees, and he could not dodge 
               the stings. He was sure he must be screaming, although he 
               could not hear his own scream.

               He almost stepped on his father, who was lying face-down in the water. His father 
               had been out in the storm so long he had used up all of his strength fighting it. 
               The pool had trapped him as he struggled home.

               It was only when Merab grabbed the outretched arm and felt 
               its limp weight that he was seized by the realization that 
               his father might already have drowned. He pulled desperately, 
               trying to turn his father over bodily, but he kept slipping 
               back.

               Then he put his hands under his father's shoulders and pulled 
               again, with all his strength, begging his father stand up.

               His father was not breathing, yet Merab was not ready to accept what he was 
               seeing. Despite the lack of movement, he continued to pull; but after each pull, his 
               father merely slid deeper into the water, never once opening his eyes.

               It was not until Ginnetho arrived that his father could be 
               dragged out completely. Only then did Merab see his father 
               move, a weak acknowledgement of Ginnetho's shouting. Tears 
               of relief warmed Merab's cheeks, and he wanted to laugh and 
               cry at the same time. Instead, he forced himself to appear 
               strong, he did not want his father to see how afraid he had 
               been.

               Eventually, they managed to get his father to stand up, and 
               Ginnetho started to push them both against the wind, toward 
               the Sabbath-house. He leaned his shoulder into his father's 
               backside and shoved, causing his father to stumble. The glance 
               he received from Ginnetho made him realize he was not helping, 
               and he suddenly felt foolish; and no match for Ginnetho as a 
               rescuer. It was painful to think that without Ginnetho, he 
               might not have saved his father.

               "Did you find Neariah?" Ginnetho was shouting into his father's ear, but he could 
               not hear his father's reply. The door of the Sabbath-house was pressed shut behind 
               them, but they continued to crawl as they caught their breath. Everyone had 
               gathered around his father, who had fallen across Teacher Berea's desk with his

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        84.


               knuckles covering his eyes. His father was trying to speak and cough at the same 
               time. "...and I found the old man. He told me Neariah was safe. He said he was 
               going to go back to fetch her."

               "He left her out in the storm?"

               "He wouldn't take me to her! The old fool just muttered 
               nonsense! He said she was safe-hiding-but he wouldn't show 
               me where she was! I just hope for his sake she is safe! If 
               that crazy old-"

               The conversation became confused as others added their convictions. Merab 
               could get no closer, he could only snatch the odd word, angry accusations among 
               thunderous impacts that shook the dripping roof. He stood alone and unnoticed 
               among the children who continued their idiot-wailing. Ginnetho was saying 
               something about the traders and the storehouse, and Merab felt himself being 
               pushed even further away from the conversation as Decimus stole his place.

               His father was coughing again. "...said it was not safe to 
               bring Neariah back yet...I let go of him...pushed his fingers 
               over my eyes...went dark...like moving with the wind, as if 
               he was squeezing my mind with...I remember someone lifting 
               me out of the water. Did somebody carry me back here? I 
               suppose I must have passed out."

               "Yes, it was Merab who found you. If he hadn't pulled you 
               out of the well, you would likely have drowned."

               The crowd parted, and his father was looking down at him.

               "Thank you, Merab." His father was swaying as he tried to 
               lean closer, and his father's face looked oddly proud.

               Merab was suddenly aware of the admiration on the faces of 
               the other adults around him too, but he found this sudden 
               elevation in status strangely embarrassing. "Oh, it was 
               nothing."

               He shrugged, and accepted his father's handshake with an 
               awkward reluctance. However, it did occur to him that he 
               might use this moment to complain about the way his father 
               had been treating him recently; he was a warrior, not a child-
               but this time he had to use the moment for another concern. 
               "Did you see Mother?"

               His father squinted, then looked around the room, as if he 
               had only just realized his mother was not present. Then he 
               grabbed Ginnetho. "Is Moserah out there as well?"

               "We don't know where she-"

               The door blew open and Spurius climbed through the doorway, 
               holding Moserah in his arms. "I need some help here! Moserah 
               twisted her ankle."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        85.


               Again, Merab was unable to get close enough to see what was going on as everyone 
               crowded around his mother. He could tell from the pitch of his mother's voice, she 
               was more angry than injured. Spurius unwrapped the wet bandages from around 
               his head and began to wind them around his mother's ankle, despite her loud 
               assurances that this was not necessary.

               "Azoic was carrying Moserah toward the oasis," Spurius was 
               saying, "and when I took her off him, he just smiled and 
               nodded, then walked away. I think he was trying to avoid 
               coming into the village, because he isn't welcome here."

               Merab moved aside to make room for his father to speak with his mother. They 
               both held each other's faces, and spoke too quietly for anyone else to hear. His 
               father then dropped his hands and they stared at each other, as if their shared 
               pain was about to turn into an argument.

               "So now we must wait!" Decimus sounded more panicstricken 
               than commanding. "But as soon as this damned storm is over, 
               and Neariah is found, you will all make damned sure the crazy 
               man stays away from us, permanently! Also, Hushah, you had 
               better make sure the damned man's hole is filled in before 
               it does any more damage!"

               Merab realized his father was ignoring Decimus. This left 
               Decimus staring at his father's back as if his father was 
               committing an unimaginable sin. Then Decimus shook his head 
               and slumped back onto the bench seat, pushing his forehead 
               into his arm as if he needed to deliberate in a deeper 
               darkness about concerns only he could understand.

               Hushah had known the night would be a long one, especially 
               for his wife. Moserah had pressed him continually to resume 
               the search, and so he had found himself adding to the general 
               speculation about the old man, claiming Azoic was protecting 
               Neariah from the storm...somewhere....

               It did not help that Decimus utterly rejected any such 
               assurance, and Moserah had eventually become so hostile she 
               had accused him of cowardice. He had retreated to join his 
               son's surveillance through the window thatch, embarrassed by 
               the continuing arguments. It seemed to him that little of 
               what was being said behind his back was rational any more, 
               and as he winked at his son he wondered how such an impetuous 
               boy had managed to become the most composed person in the 
               village.

               With the first light of dawn, the storm expired and a deathly silence gripped the 
               desert. The sun now commanded a clear blue sky, yet the air remained cold and 
               still, so cold it stung when passing into their bodies. For the children this was a 
               terrifying experience. They tried valiantly to recapture their own vapors in fear of 
               losing their souls, until a few words from one of the adults turned their anxieties 
               into play. They were soon imitating fire-breathing monsters with much enthusiasm, 
               despite being cold, tired and wet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        86.


               The day's search started immediately; some began building a 
               beacon fire, while others fanned out in different directions.

               Some distance away, Hushah could clearly see his wife holding 
               on to Spurius as she limped. She had been in no mood to 
               consider his suggestion that she remain in the village.

               The search parties were each supposed to follow routes that 
               would keep them within sight of each other, crossing paths 
               several times per day. They were to walk in groups, each 
               carrying a sack of water and plenty of dried chips of kangaroo 
               meat from the storehouse. Merab and Hushah had formed a search 
               party of their own, in which Merab chose to carry a broken 
               tree branch. He was stabbing his own shadow with it.

               Despite his fears, Hushah repeatedly smiled at Merab's 
               pretentious antics. The sand was a rigid crust, which formed 
               angular shapes, resembling stone plateaus. So, with each 
               stab of his crooked staff, the small prince was carving a 
               valley of craters. Hushah could only hope the staff would 
               keep Merab in good spirits for a while, but this search might 
               go on for many days. He could not stop himself from wondering 
               what they would do if Neariah were never found. He knew 
               everyone would blame him, and in truth, he would also blame 
               himself.

               Hushah realized Merab had ceased his own shadow, and the boy 
               was standing still as if he had seen a ghost. "What is it, 
               Merab? Can you see Neariah?"  He looked into the distance; 
               where, void of the usual heat shimmers, the clear air made 
               an alien ground feel threatening.

               Merab slowly relaxed. "No, I think it's a chicken."

               Hushah pushed himself to sound pleased, "Oh, good."

               "Don't worry, Father. She is alive."

               "What? Yes, of course she is." He looked away from his 
               courageous son, and shook his head. All of his hopes now 
               rested upon the capability of that old, crazy stranger. 
               Moserah had said enough during the previous night to make 
               him, and everyone else, realize what a pathetic father he 
               was. Only his son seemed to have any faith left in him.

               Merab started running toward the chicken as if he had all 
               the energy in the world. Hushah was tempted to hold the boy 
               back and tell him to save his strength, but Merab's strength 
               would probably outlast his father's. His son was already 
               some way ahead before he could persuade his own weary eyes 
               to properly examine the target of his son's quest.

               There seemed to be no end to the wreckage that had been plucked out of 
               Summerville. Pieces of their broken lives lay strewn about, half-submerged like 
               the flotsam in one of Jaalam's sea-paintings. Hushah stared at the possible-chicken

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        87.


               and wondered whether it would still be alive. It was not logical, but if the chicken 
               was still alive, perhaps his daughter....

               He was already losing hope, despite his son's shouts of 
               encouragement. "Yes, Merab. I'm coming." He picked up his 
               pace, still squinting at the probable-chicken, albeit with 
               increasing suspicion. Then he too began to run.

               "Is that a person, Merab? Is it Azoic?"

               "Yes, and Neariah!"

               "Are you certain?" Hushah could see other villagers changing in the same direction. 
               He could hear Moserah and Spurius shouting, and he could now see it was indeed 
               Neariah, lying motionless in the crazy man's arms.

               "She's dead!" Merab had reached the crazy man, and he was 
               trying to pull his sister away while shouting, "Murderer!"

               Hushah's heart flooded with fear and sank into his stomach 
               as if he was about to be sick. He dived between the crazy 
               man and his children, slamming his shoulder against the crazy 
               man's chest and ripping Neariah into his arms as he turned 
               his back on the crazy man. Only then did her little body 
               stiffen.

               "Possum, are you hurt?"

               "Aw, Daddy, I'm fine," she chided, as her little arms 
               stretched outward. "I was just sleeping. Did you know that 
               Azoic can make you fall sleep just by waggling a finger at 
               you?"

               Hushah inspected her, feeling for breakages in her limbs, 
               still unable to believe she was unharmed. "You have no idea 
               how worried we were, Possum. Where were you?"

               She began crying, and he patted her hair to let her know she 
               was safe now. The crazy man was moving away, and he began 
               humming faintly as Hushah stared at him. "Where was she? 
               Where did you take her? Why did you keep her out in the storm? 
               Why didn't you bring her home sooner?"

               "I was, hmmm, I'm sorry. I didn't know-"

               "What Azoic means, Daddy," said Neariah, "is that we had to 
               hide inside a huge rock because Nature was too angry to let 
               us go home. Nature was not angry with anyone in Summerdale 
               though, although I could quite understand if Nature was. No, 
               Nature was angry with the little gods."

               "The what?"

               "Oh, you see, Azoic was telling me secret stories. The little gods were fighting 
               about who was going to be in charge of

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        88.


               the world, and they were spitting lightning at each other, which was hurting Nature. 
               It was quite frightening at times, you know.

               We had quite a huge adventure."

               Hushah looked again at the crazy man, "What nonsense have 
               you been saying to her? We thought she was dead! Why didn't 
               you bring her home?"  The crazy man wheezed helplessly and 
               looked down, and Hushah instantly regretted shouting. "Look, 
               I'm sorry. You did well to find her, but-"

               "Neariah!" Moserah limped up to them with tears of relief 
               streaming down her face, and wrapped her arms around Neariah's 
               head. "Where were you, baby?"

               "Watching the storm," came the muffled response.

               Moserah glanced at Hushah, and then frowned at their child.

               "Don't you know how dangerous it is to walk out into the 
               desert? Don't you know you should never, ever, ever walk out 
               into the desert? What were you thinking?"

               Neariah began crying again. "I didn't mean any harm."

               The crazy man began to mumble. "Ah, I...mmmm...sorry, I 
               ah...I, ah.... Humph."

               Spurius pushed himself into the conversation by grabbing the crazy man's tunic 
               and panted into his face. "What were you doing, you crazy old fool!"  Spurius' 
               scalp bulged with angry blue veins. Hushah released Neariah into Moserah's arms 
               and readied himself to restrain his brother.

               Azoic was trying to retreat from Spurius' grip. "We, ah, 
               I...the wind...I was...telling stories...."

               "In a storm? Are you completely-"

               "Spurius, let him be." Hushah was surprised at the stern 
               tone in his own voice, and even more surprised that his 
               brother immediately did as he was asked. "We all need to 
               relax for a while. We have Neariah back again, which is all 
               that matters for the moment. We should get back to the village 
               and get some warm food inside us, and then decide what to do 
               about...other things." He pulled the confused Spurius away 
               with a stiff smile, but he had to physically turn his brother 
               away from Azoic before anyone would start walking back toward 
               Summerdale.

               They walked close together as they watched the smoke from the beacon fire rising 
               out of their distant oasis. Hushah looked back and waved to Azoic to follow, but 
               the sad-looking man just stood motionless in the distance. Hushah waved at him 
               several times until the man slowly began shuffling along behind them with obvious 
               reluctance. He looked even more ashamed of himself than usual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        89.


               Hushah shook his head; it should not be this way. Azoic did 
               not deserve to feel such shame, he deserved to be thanked 
               for rescuing Neariah. So, despite Decimus, despite Moserah 
               and despite the other villagers, he was going make things 
               right. He was going to find a way to give Azoic a home.

               

               All of the grown-ups were marveling at the beacon fire, but Neariah did not finding 
               it so inspiring. The flames seemed determined to bake her sensitive skin; they 
               were snapping and grunting and she was being forced to dodge about as they 
               spat at her. Yet, her mother insisted she stand still and be polite as everyone around 
               her said everything that could possibly be said about how lucky she was. How 
               many more hugs, pokes and prods could a person endure? She rested the latest 
               bowl of vegetable broth on the ground and sighed deeply as she fanned her raw 
               cheeks with sweaty hands. She was no longer even the slightest bit hungry. In 
               fact, it almost hurt to swallow. Yet, here again, there was no mercy.

               She knew no matter how far she stretched out her stomach to 
               show how full she was, there would always be another bowl of 
               soup waiting for her. She was sure she would be sick if she 
               didn't get her freedom back soon.

               Such were the sacrifices of sudden popularity. She could 
               remember a time when all she had ever wanted was popularity, 
               a time when nobody had ever taken any notice of her. She 
               could never have imagined that popularity could be so 
               unpleasant.

               Perhaps Azoic was better off being unpopular.

               Azoic had spent some moments staring down into the fire's 
               pit, perhaps because the fire had been built within the 
               remains of his well. His dreams would thus have seemed buried.

               Eventually, her father had pushed a razor and piece of shaving 
               soap into Azoic's hands. It had been a curious gift, and she 
               had watched her father with some suspicion as he pushed Azoic 
               away, toward the lake.

               Her father rarely looked so anxious, and she began to 
               anticipate what he might do next as she watched him pacing 
               around the burned-out well. He was rubbing his forehead as 
               if he was making great a plan, and she felt sure such a plan 
               would involve Azoic.

               On their way back to the oasis, she had repeatedly asked her 
               father where Azoic was going to live from now on, and he had 
               repeatedly whispered, "Wait and see". So, she was now waiting 
               to see, as patiently as she was able.

               "Come and have some soup, Hushah." Decimus was directing the distribution of 
               soup, quite unnecessarily. "Is it not ironic that the well should be turned into a fire-
               pit?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        90.


               Of course, the storm was probably God's way of reminding us that I was right.

               God acts in mysterious ways."

               "No, I don't think so."

               "What was that?"

               "I said I don't think God was telling us that."

               Decimus leaned back on his heals. "What? Is there something 
               wrong with you?"

               Everyone was looking at her father now, and he was frowning 
               at the fire as if he did not want to look back at them.

               He said, "It would have been useful."

               "What?"

               "The well, it would have been useful."

               "Now Hushah, we have already put this matter to rest. We all 
               know that ridiculous thing was a dangerous nuisance."

               The grown-ups had all become very quiet, and their silence 
               seemed to pull at Neariah as if she was being invited to 
               tell Decimus what an idiot he was. Her father would probably 
               do a much better job of it, so she bit her lip to hold back 
               her words.

               It was never a good idea to speak when grown-ups were 
               fighting, but even so, she had words that needed to come out 
               and she was not sure how long she could restrain them.

               Decimus began to look around and chuckle, as if inviting 
               others to laugh at her father. She blew at her hair as loudly 
               as she could, in the hope that Decimus might look in her 
               direction, but he did not. He was probably unwilling to pick 
               on someone his own size.

               "Don't be an idiot, Decimus." Her uncle had stolen the words from out of her mouth, 
               and her uncle had also stepped up beside her father. The burned face made him 
               look even more frustrated with Decimus than usual. "There could be spring-water 
               under that fire, and not so far down, either. We had puddles all around this area 
               while it was raining, so perhaps there is an underground stream feeding the lake, 
               right Hushah? A well here could be invaluable. Every dry season forces us to dig 
               through dried mud, and maybe one day the rains will not come soon enough.

               The well is an excellent insurance-"

               "We have a more important concern." Decimus pulled the soup spoon out of the 
               cauldron and began waving it at everyone, as if soup-eating was the more important 
               concern. "These are idle discussions about unlikely events. Our village must be

                                                                        91.


               repaired. Our homes, and our trade business, are much higher priorities than any-
               "

               "And in our spare time, we will finish building Azoic's well,"

               Spurius concluded.

               Decimus squinted. "Who is 'we'?"

               "Me." Neariah clapped her hands together, voting herself in, 
               but Decimus ignored the interruption.

               Decimus' spoon was pointing like a sword. "You have to go 
               back to Erebus to demand compensation for our loss of trade 
               assets. Surely you are not suggesting a mere well is more 
               important than our livelihoods?"

               "Of course not, Decimus. Building the well will take only a 
               short while. The water table is still high, which will make 
               the digging easier. The wet-packed sand will help to keep 
               the dig narrow, and the colder temperatures will slow the 
               cement setting as we build the wall. I have never known the 
               desert to be so favorably inclined toward well-building, as 
               if God intended a well to be built, but the desert will not 
               stay cool much longer. I don't suppose you would like to 
               help us with the building work, would you, Decimus?"

               Decimus sniffed, red-faced. "Go ahead. Dig yourself a hole, if that is what you 
               feel you have to do. However, I am warning you, all you will discover under the 
               sand is more sand. Let us all hope that you will soon become sufficiently 
               embarrassed by your misguided deeds.

               "What is more, let us all hope that you eventually come to 
               your senses before the damned thing swallows you alive. Of 
               course, I should point out that Azoic will be leaving for 
               Everdale tomorrow, so you should not count on his pathetic 
               contribution to your senseless project."

               Her uncle turned to stare at her father, as if to silently 
               ask a question her father seemed unable to answer. Then her 
               father shrugged and said, "I suppose Decimus must have 
               persuaded Lucius to take Azoic to Everdale."

               The bowl of soup flew into the fire as Neariah kicked it out 
               of her way. "You can't make him leave now, not after all we 
               went through to get him back!"

               "Be quiet, Neariah." Decimus flicked his spoon at her as one might swat a fly, but 
               as he did so he was smiling at those around him. "Yes, that is quite correct, ladies 
               and gentlemen.  Lucius has generously offered to escort Azoic to Everdale, and, 
               to show our appreciation, I have agreed to lend Lucius a few of our supplies-" 
               everyone looked shocked "-supplies which we would not be in any position to give 
               to him if he had not rescued said supplies from the storm. Had it not

                                                                        92.


               been for his extraordinary efforts to protect the store, we would not even be eating 
               this soup."

               The spoon was now being presented as evidence of their debt to Lucius. "We 
               were lucky that such a heroic man came to Summerdale when he did. Would you 
               like some more of this delicious soup, Lucius? Yes, ah, you do have a hearty 
               appetite, don't you?  How wonderful. We owe you and your men our gratitude, so 
               if there is anything we can do to help you as you repair your wagon, please feel 
               free to ask any one of us. Oh, except Spurius of course, since he will be busy with 
               his well.

               "Aside from him, Ginnetho can help you splice and rim your 
               wheels, Jaalam paints, and Cabul can look after your mule. 
               We are all ready to help, because we realize how important 
               it is to ensure that Azoic moves on as quickly as possible."  
               Decimus glanced at Neariah for the first time, but looked 
               away quickly.

               "And Lucius, you do understand the urgency of our requirement, 
               don't you, Lucius?"

               "Oh, yes, Mr. Decimus, I do indeed. We can't have a crazy 
               man running around setting fires in every town he comes 
               across, can we? We will look after him until we reach the 
               appropriate authorities."

               Neariah almost screamed with frustration. "He did not start any fires!"  She had 
               not liked these traders from the moment she saw them, but now she hated them 
               as much as she hated Decimus. "Why are you all acting so blind?  How do you 
               know it wasn't these ugly traders who started the fires?"

               There was a moment of silence, and then a sudden chorus of 
               loud laughter. She moved to stand beside her father and her 
               uncle, the only grown-ups who were not laughing at her. Her 
               own mother, who was passing out soup, was also smiling.

               "Neariah, go and take some soup to Azoic." Her mother's hands 
               were on her hips, indicating it was unwise to argue.

               "But Mommy, we can't-"

               "I said, go and take some soup to Azoic!"

               She looked around at her father. "But-"

               "Go along, Possum. I'll come and...." He did not finish his 
               sentence. He was looking over her head, toward her mother, 
               and he was shaking his head.

               Neariah made slow and noisy work of picking up a bowl, then waited for Decimus 
               to fill it with more of their horrible soup. As she started on her way, she could feel 
               the smiles of every villager in the village, like needles in her back. She knew this 
               was not the time to argue, but she turned for one last protest anyway. Her mother 
               was leading her father

                                                                        93.


               away by the elbow, and both of them were too preoccupied by their own discussion 
               to notice how much she wanted to say.

               She bit her lip and sighed. It seemed Decimus was winning again, but she was 
               not yet defeated. She understood what her father and uncle had tried to do for 
               Azoic, and she was proud of them for confronting Decimus. Even so, it was the 
               rest of the village that now needed to be confronted, not Decimus. If she could 
               only prove to everyone that the well was a good idea, then she might also be able 
               to prove that Azoic was a good person.

               So, if Azoic had almost finished his well in one night, then 
               surely with a bit of help, Azoic could complete the well 
               before the traders could steal Azoic away. It would take the 
               traders a while to repair their wagon; all was not lost. 
               Just as Azoic had told her while he was carrying her home, 
               "With faith we are never lost."

               However, there were a few things that Azoic needed to learn 
               before anyone would accept that the well was a good idea. 
               She was going to have to teach Azoic to change his behavior-
               but not too much-she did not want him to become so popular 
               that everyone would have to hug and prod and poke him, that 
               would be unkind. She just wanted him to become popular enough 
               that he could live happily ever after.

               "With faith we are never lost? What are you talking about? 
               You sound like Azoic?"

               Her brother had been watching her from behind a tree.

               Confronting him, she asked, "Were you spying on me?"

               "I don't think you should play with the crazy man anymore.

               You can see what trouble he causes around here, and you should 
               have heard what Mother and Father were saying about him when 
               you were gone!"

               "Oh, and what did Mommy and Daddy say?"

               "I don't remember!" Merab turned away and sniffed.

               "But he saved my life! Why doesn't anyone like him?"

               "How should I know what grown-ups think?"

               "It was quite a big adventure, you know."

               "Oh yeah? Sounds boring, just sitting in a rain storm-hurrh!"

               His last word had been designed to maximize the size of the 
               steam cloud his breath poured onto her face.

               She blew away the hair on her forehead and scowled at him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        94.


               "But it really was an adventure! We could have died out there! 
               We had to think about stories all night so we wouldn't get 
               frightened. He tells such funny stories!"

               "Yeah? Like what?"

               "About different worlds where plants are blue and creatures 
               run around worshipping silly gods by saying." She scrunched 
               up her face and flapped her free arm, "blub-a-lub-a-lub-a-
               lub!"

               Merab laughed as he imitated her. "What else did he say?"

               "Lots! I could tell you more, but only if you would be so 
               kind as to hold the branches out of my way."

               She knew Merab would only cooperate for as long as she kept 
               telling stories, but she felt slightly guilty about telling 
               him about secret worlds, which nobody except she and Azoic 
               aught to know about. Were secrets always this slippery? She 
               was also becoming increasingly aware that they were walking 
               through absolute silence, the absence of all normal signs of 
               life-not just the absence of rustling leaves, but also the 
               absence of any buzzing insects or chirping birds. No whispers 
               of wind were stirring the rancid air, and the steam from the 
               soup stole straight upward, as if to escape the overpowering 
               presence of rotten swamp-water.

               She had once known every corner of these woods, but her 
               playgrounds were no longer the same. She had been prepared 
               to see many damaged trees, like those in the village, but to 
               have so many of her memories ripped out by the roots left 
               her feeling disassociated from all she saw. She felt like a 
               visitor in one of Azoic's strange worlds.

               The trees stood naked, stripped of leaves, polished to a 
               glassy smoothness and glistening wherever sunlight stroked 
               them. In deeper shadows, limbs remained varnished with a 
               snaky-feeling substance, which slithered away and oozed water 
               if she placed a hot hand upon them.

               Her brother did not seem to find these changes so unsettling.

               He was clawing at a tree's snakeskin, dissecting his victim 
               and causing sharp popping sounds, which echoed out into the 
               stillness. His shiny trophy slipped through his fingers and 
               chiseled into a stiff fern, tearing it into a crystal-shower, 
               which bounced across the unyielding leaf-litter. She could 
               not help but wonder whether Nature felt any pain, or whether 
               it was just numb like her feet.

               "Hey, did you see that one? This is fantastic!" He was yelling 
               through his own echoes. Merab obviously had no respect for 
               the suffering around him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        95.


               She whispered, "Azoic says you should not interfere with 
               Nature." She quite expected Merab to ignore her advice, which 
               he did.

               "Who cares what Azoic says, he also says blub-a-lub-a-lub."

               He snapped another branch, managing to scatter countless 
               white splinters over her head. The splinters turned into 
               watery droplets as they stabbed her, and he laughed when she 
               spilled some of the soup.

               "Will you please stop that, 'Raby. It is already difficult 
               enough to walk on this snakey stuff. Why do you have to be 
               so mean all the time?"

               "Oh, it's only ice, it can't really hurt you. Uncle Spike 
               says there is lots of this stuff in the mountains, and he 
               says it grows there all the time, instead of trees. When the 
               crazy man goes to the mountains to live, he will probably 
               have to build his house out of this stuff."

               "I wish you were a nice brother. You never say anything nice."

               "I don't?" He stopped and stared at her as if he had never 
               before given the issue any thought.

               "No, you don't. You are always mean."

               "These woods really smell bad, like they are dead."

               "You are just trying to change the subject, 'Raby."

               "What subject?"

               "Don't you like me, Merab?"

               "What? Oh, that again. Look, I don't know. Why do you ask 
               such stupid questions?"

               "I just want to know, that's all."

               "If I didn't like you, why would I go searching for you?"

               "Were you worried about me?"

               "No." He looked at her again, and made a face as if he was 
               going to be sick, then he shrugged. "I don't know."

               Neariah stopped. "Thank you for being so worried, 'Raby."

               He was now staring at her, as if he was shocked she would thank him for anything. 
               They were sharing a rare moment of friendship, but it obviously made Merab 
               uncomfortable because he hunched his back toward her and started talking to the

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        96.


               ground. "So, it was not important. I knew you would come home eventually."

               "Were you worried about Azoic, too?"

               "No, he didn't seem to get blown around like everyone else.

               He kept running in and out of the village like he was made 
               of wind himself. He is really strong for an old man. He was 
               running, and holding pigs and chickens, and the wind was....

               "Anyway, nobody believed me, but when daylight came, they 
               found all kinds of stuff tied down in one of the guest huts, 
               but Decimus thanked Lucius for having rescued it all." He 
               turned to face her. "If I hadn't seen the crazy man running 
               around like a bandicoot, I wouldn't have believed it either."

               "Yes, he told me he was worried about the pigs. He said he 
               could hear them inside his head, squealing with fear, and he 
               was going to find them."

               "That's incredible, especially when the old fool can't even 
               find himself, usually-"

               "There you go again, being mean."

               "If he was running around looking for pigs, you must have 
               been out in the storm on your own."

               "Yes. He had to leave me." She smiled at the surprised look 
               on Merab's face. "Actually, I don't remember that part very 
               well. It seemed to happen too quickly for it to be 
               frightening.

               Azoic sees things that are too far away to see, so I knew he 
               was keeping an eye on me, where ever he was."

               "Oh, good grief. You are as crazy as he is." Merab leaped up and landed squarely 
               on a mirror-surfaced puddle. It screeched as a crack spread across it, splitting it 
               apart to reveal a crunchy mosaic of leaves. "Uncle Spurius says ice is just water in 
               diguise, like when steam is soup in disguise. He says everything is in disguise, 
               even the world around us. If you warm up a tree it becomes a fire, and if you warm 
               up metal it becomes soup you can't drink."

               "You don't believe me, about Azoic being magical, do you?"

               "Is this an interrogation?"

               "No, I just want you to understand what he is. He got tangled 
               up in a piece of lightning, although he called it energy, or 
               something like that. Anyway, he said the energy was what 
               taught him to see with his eyes closed." She could tell Merab 
               was trying to look interested in other things. He was 
               examining reflections captured in a large, black shard of 
               ice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        97.


               "Yeah, the crazy man looks like he gets struck by lightning 
               all the time. I never saw sheet-lightning before, nor ice, 
               even in the worst rainy season. Do you think Azoic did all 
               this, with his, ah, magic?"

               "Azoic would never hurt Nature."

               He had permitted her to overtake him, so he was now behind 
               her when he said, "And there he is!"

               Azoic was standing on a huge gray expanse of hard water, 
               which had once been their lake. He was as motionless as the 
               trees, as if he was lost in one of his daydreams again.

               "Yes, just as I expected, he looks like he has died again."

               Merab crunched past her, waving his arms to keep his balance, 
               and in doing so he pushed her over. The bowl slipped from 
               her hands and cracked against the ground's glossy coating.

               "Merab, look what you did." She watched him sliding out onto 
               the slippery lake, with no intention of apologizing. Like 
               everyone else, Merab was always angry with Azoic, so she 
               decided to leave the soup where it was and hurry after him.

               There was still the slim hope she might distract Merab before 
               he insulted poor Azoic.

               Merab began shouting, "Why did you leave my sister out in 
               the desert, old man?"

               So much for hope. She pushed her way through the brittle 
               undergrowth, which rimmed the edge of the lake like a wall 
               of spears. The huge expanse of diseased grayness creaked as 
               she jumped onto it.

               Merab shouted again, "You don't deserve to be alive."

               She shuffled forward, grabbing at her brother's shoulder as she slid past him. 
               Together they span around each other, and it was not until she was at last able to 
               look away from her own feet that she noticed Merab's expression. He was again 
               staring up at Azoic with his jaw hanging open. Above them: Azoic's face-a face 
               she was now seeing for the first time.

               It was a perfect face, so perfectly smooth and symmetrical 
               that, without any expression, it did not look real. Except 
               for a few strands of hair, still clinging to his cheeks, 
               there were no blemishes. It was as if his beard had afforded 
               his skin complete protection from the sun. His eyes seemed 
               larger, and less dark, although his eyebrows were still too 
               bushy. He had thin lips and a square chin, and she realized 
               she had never before imagined Azoic having a chin. He was 
               very handsome, and she had to blink to make sure she was not 
               imagining things.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        98.


               This man's face was beautiful.

               "See, I told you he's an angel," she heard herself whisper.

               "He must have pulled his hair out by the roots."

               She noticed the shaver and soap in his hand, where her father 
               had put them. They did not look like they had been used. By 
               his feet, long white strands were clinging to the gray 
               surface, as if the ice was growing its own hair.

               "Azoic?" She needed to hear his voice, not just because he 
               was so still, but also because his skin was so pale. He looked 
               cold, and sick, like the trees. There was no mist around his 
               nose, and she had to watch his chest to reassure herself he 
               was still breathing, albeit slowly. Even the air he was 
               exhaling was deathly cold. "Can you hear me, Azoic? Are you 
               dying?"

               "Hmmm...?" His eyes moved to look down at her, and she shrank 
               away from him. As he focused on her, the expression filling 
               his gentle face was one of such overwhelming sadness.

               She began to feel the need to hug him instead of fleeing 
               from him. He stroked at his cheeks and then pulled a tuft of 
               hair out of one of his eyebrows, bringing tears to his eyes.

               She cried out as if she too had felt the pain. "Azoic! Don't 
               do that. You need eyebrows. Don't you know how to shave?"

               "Everything is shiny. Nature is not supposed to be shiny."

               Merab screwed up his nose. "He doesn't need to run off and 
               find his mind again, does he?"

               Neariah pretended that her brother had not spoken. She smiled 
               up at Azoic as kindly as she could, to say, "You look much 
               better without your beard. You look much...ah...younger."

               "Nature needs warmth, for life. The storm was sent by dead 
               gods. They are at war again."

               "Dead gods?" Merab puffed out an extra large sigh into the 
               chilly space between her and Azoic. "What is all this talk 
               about dead gods? There is only one God, not many gods. Do 
               you know what I think?"

               Azoic's gray eyes squinted at the gray ice. "Nature does not 
               approve of me. I am not natural."

               "Good guess." Merab was staring at Azoic with a look of 
               disgust. "But actually I was going to say God doesn't approve 
               of you because you don't make sense, and you're useless and 
               you always bring trouble."

                                                                        99.


               She could not let this go on any longer. "Azoic, you have to 
               act normal. You can't keep saying weird things, especially 
               about God. Insulting God is terribly bad, you know. So, stop 
               it. I want you to be normal, immediately!"

               "Energet chatter. I hear them, in my head, like flies-"

               "Azoic, stop it!" There were tears pouring down her cheeks, 
               but she did not know why. "If you hear flies, you just have 
               to ignore them."

               "Yeah, be a normal angel." Merab smirked.

               She stared fiercely at Merab, who closed his mouth as he 
               noticed her angry tears. "Azoic, I want you to promise me 
               you will behave yourself, and you will not talk about silly 
               things anymore."

               "I do not belong here with-"

               "Yes, you do!" She tried to stamp on the slippery surface, 
               but only succeeded in making a fool of herself as she tried 
               to regain her balance. The lake seemed to be groaning in 
               pain.

               "Summerdale is your home, and we are going to finish your 
               well; you and me and Daddy and Uncle Spurius and Merab.

               We will show everyone you are a good person because you can 
               build a well, and then we will build you a house to live in. 
               I'm sure if you ask everyone nicely they will help, but you 
               have to ask them with more...you have to be more familiar."

               "Who said anything about building a stupid well?" Merab was 
               frowning.

               "'Raby, please, we need your help. Don't we, Azoic?"

               Merab was still staring at her wet cheeks. "You do?" His put 
               his weight on one foot while his spare foot swung back and 
               forth over the ice. "I suppose I could help a little, if it 
               means so much to you."

               "Thank you, 'Raby." She lifted her arms to hug him, but he 
               backed away as if she was attacking him.

               "Look, it's nothing, just stop crying, will you?"

               She nodded and wiped away the tears. Then she took a deep 
               breath, skidded closer to Azoic and put her hands on his 
               chest.

               "And you! Are you going to promise me you will act normal in 
               front of everyone, and you will not be so depressed all the 
               time, or not?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       100.


               "I was called to mediate between the gods, like an angel, 
               yes-" He was laughing.

               It was the first time she had ever seen him laugh, but it made his sad face look 
               even sadder. "Here I am, alive yet dead. How can I choose between you, and the 
               command of...."  His face suddenly relaxed, all expression fading as he stared out 
               over the lake, as if his mind was again being pulled away into his distant world of 
               daydreams.

               She poked her fingers into his stomach. "I don't want you to 
               do that anymore, either."

               "Hmmm?" He refocused upon her and his smile returned, filling 
               his face with a kindness that made his eyes sparkle. "It 
               would be an honor to serve you, Madam Warlady."

               Merab leaped into the air and landed with a deep thump.

               "Yeah! We could all be warlords. This is like a war against 
               Decimus." Merab was rubbing his hands together. "Decimus and 
               the smelly traders, versus the warlords of Summerdale!"

               Neariah shook her head. "No, this is not a game, Merab. This 
               is serious, and we don't have much time. If we don't finish 
               the well before the traders finish their wagon.... Horrible 
               things might happen to Azoic. We don't want that, do we?"

               Merab appeared to be considering whether he should say 
               something stupid to irritate her again, but she was surprised 
               to hear him say, "Don't worry. God doesn't belong to Decimus."

               She smiled, looking at her brother with newfound respect as 
               she hugged Azoic's hand. Then she whispered, but loud enough 
               for her brother to hear, "Nobody just kicks an angel out of-
               " there was a loud grunt underneath them "-ah, I'm not sure 
               I like this ice stuff. We should get off it."

               They started to slide toward the bushes, but as they did so, 
               the noises grew louder. She could imagine something very 
               large trying to push up through their gray platform, and 
               despite her painfully numb feet she could feel the vibrations 
               such a monster would make.

               There were screeches behind her, and grunting sounds, and a 
               splashing sound, and she looked back expecting to see 
               something rising up to grab her, but instead she saw nothing.

               She slid to a stop. "Where is Azoic?"

               "He must have fallen through." Merab was pointing at a dark 
               triangular area from which cracks were radiating. "Stay away, 
               Neariah, it's not safe!"

               She was shuffling toward the dark triangle, over new cracks that were clawing 
               around her feet. "Azoic?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       101.


               The shudders started again as she began to splash through the thin layer of water 
               around the ice-hole.

               The water inside the triangle was black, as if it went down forever, and she knew 
               she was not going to be able to see anything when she jumped into it. She could 
               hear Merab calling to her, but she was no longer aware of what he was saying. 
               She barely had time to fill her lungs, knowing she would need all the air she could 
               hold.

               Her feet lifted over the sharp edge of the triangle, and she 
               gritted her teeth so that she would not scream out her 
               precious air. She was diving into a darkness where monsters 
               lived, and as coldness licked her body, swallowing her, all 
               of her muscles tensed. Something was biting around her waist 
               and she screamed bubbles. This was the end.

               Then she felt herself being lifted bodily out of the water. 
               There were hands on her waist, and she was hanging in mid 
               air, looking down upon Azoic's wet hair. He was standing up 
               to his own waist in the triangle of water, and smiling at 
               her.

               "The cold is not for Nature's children."

               "You can stand in there? Why were you below the water? Were 
               you swimming...in that?"

               "I was listening to energet chatter. It sings louder in the 
               dark, where it is cold, away from Nature's singing."

               "You aren't making any sense. You promised-" Her whole body 
               started to shiver violently.

               "Yes, I am sorry, Neariah." His jaw tightened and he closed 
               his eyes. "I was swimming because the water was-ah- 
               refreshing, to me."

               "That's better." She was lowered onto the ice-shelf where 
               she immediately started to help Azoic climb out and slide 
               toward the stiff bushes. Merab was still watching them with 
               wide eyes.

               She glanced sideways at her brother, silently warning him 
               not to say anything as she led the way, and as he let her 
               lead the way.

               The air felt even colder now she was wet, but the hard coating 
               over the trees was beginning to rain drips upon them. "When 
               we get back to the fire", she whispered, "do not tell anyone 
               what happened. Just say we got soaked by dripping trees, 
               right?"

               There was no response from behind her, and as she glanced back she could see 
               Merab was not frowning at her. Instead, he seemed preoccupied as he stared at 
               the back of Azoic's

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       102.


               head, and she had to wonder whether her brother was at last beginning to see the 
               magic in her angel.

               It was a sleepless night. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, wrestling with 
               worries that were greater than her understanding. The worry that consumed her 
               the most was Azoic's new face. Like everyone else, she had become fascinated 
               by it.

               Each time Azoic remembered to give himself an expression, 
               she felt the same things he seemed to be feeling. Each time 
               he laughed, she too needed to laugh; when he looked puzzled, 
               she too felt puzzled; when he looked sad, she too felt the 
               weight of unbearable burdens. Trying to cope with these shared 
               emotions was almost as exhausting as digging.

               By evening, a sizable crowd of spectators had gathered, all 
               waiting for Azoic to smile again; except for Decimus of 
               course.

               Decimus had not been so impressed with the changes, and he 
               had shooed everyone away by quoting one of his long-winded 
               policies. He had then gone over to consult with his new 
               traderfriends, who had also been staring at Azoic.

               She had become increasingly irritated by their evil presence, so when she had 
               overheard them speculating about Azoic's past, she had marched upon them to 
               defend Azoic personally.  That had resulted in her being sent to bed early. Thus, 
               her current torture was all the fault of that mean Decimus. Somebody had to do 
               something about that nasty grown-up. Why couldn't Azoic be their Elder instead?  
               She was not entirely sure what Elders were supposed to do make themselves 
               more Elder-ish, but being an angel would certainly have to be a qualification Decimus 
               could not match.

               The difficult part about turning Azoic into an Elder would 
               be the need to convince everyone else in the village that 
               angels actually existed.

               Oh, she knew that everyone claimed to believe in angels, but 
               obviously they didn't. Perhaps angels that could be seen 
               were more difficult to believe in than ones that were 
               invisible. 'Blind faith' was what Azoic called it. It was a 
               good job God was invisible, otherwise nobody would believe 
               in anything.

               They were still digging outside. She could hear the distant 
               rasp of shovels, and she was reminded of how very proud she 
               had become of her father, her uncle, and most of all Merab.

               They had each volunteered to help with the digging. Yet, she 
               was also irritated, because they were now making excellent 
               progress without her.

               She had been the Chief Bucket-Person. Her uncle had been the Assistant Bucket-
               Person. She had grown expert at judging

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       103.


               when to release the rope, by the sounds coming out of the well.

               Her father would stop grunting under the weight of his rockhammer, there would 
               be a shuffling sound and then she would shout "Bucket!", and he would shout 
               "Ouch!" She smiled, he had just been pretending to be hurt.

               It was so unfair that she should now have to sit here in bed 
               all night, just listening, when she ought to be outside 
               helping.

               Merab had also been sent to bed, eventually. She knew he had 
               also remained awake to listen.

               He had been tapping on the wall, sending messages to her 
               about well-building as if he had been Chief of Everything. 
               Then he had stopped tapping, probably due to his frustration 
               with her replies, or her tapping errors.

               Why did he insist on using his dumb, secret codes, instead 
               of just talking like a normal person? Boys could be complete 
               idiots.

               It was still dark when she finally found the courage to 
               venture out and assess the progress. She could not allow 
               herself be seen outside until after the cock began its 
               tuneless screeching, so her investigation had to at least 
               begin surreptitiously.

               They had built a circular wall around the pit, a wall almost as tall as she was. Also, 
               there was a wooden structure standing over the wall, supporting a thatch-roof. A 
               wheel was attached under this roof, from which hung a rope, one end dangling 
               into the well, the other attached to her bucket.

               She was disappointed that a Chief Bucket-Person would no 
               longer be required, as if she had been replaced by a stupid 
               mechanical thing. However, she could forgive it if there was 
               something else she could do that would be as much fun as 
               Bucket-Person being. Judging by the muffled grunts rising up 
               from below, the pit was much deeper than it had been. Also, 
               judging by the grunts, both her father and uncle could now 
               fit inside the well at the same time. Although, they were 
               probably standing one above the other on some of the step-
               pegs that protruded inward from the well's new wall.

               Azoic was leaning over the wall, looking down. She shook her 
               head at him as she watched. He was settling his lantern on 
               the wall with such tenderness. It looked like he was afraid 
               of scratching one or the other. She crept closer, peering 
               around anxiously to make sure nobody else was stirring.

               As Azoic started to greet her, she put her fingers to her lips and waved him to 
               come closer, away from the well. She whispered, "Good morning, Azoic. I'm just 
               visiting you, and I might have to go run back to bed in a moment. I'm not

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       104.


               allowed out until dawn. Please, don't tell Daddy I was here. The well looks great. 
               Is it finished?"

               "Humph. Not finished." The face was smeared with dirt and 
               the day was dim, but she could still see his gloomy 
               expression.

               "No, but I'm sure we will have everything done very soon.

               Did you find water yet?"

               "Not enough."

               "So you found some then?" She put her hand over her mouth; 
               she could barely contain her excitement. "Is there another 
               lake down there, is it very deep?"

               "Not deep enough."

               "Yes, but how deep is that? You should be happy. Anybody 
               would think you were digging your own grave."

               "Mmmm." He nodded as if to agree. "Not oil enough." His rusty 
               old lantern was flickering, as if it was about to go out.

               A scuffing sound came from the storehouse, and she backed away nervously. 
               "Shhhh," she made a pushing gesture to show Azoic how to retreat and stand by 
               the well. Of course, she should have known Azoic would just stand there looking 
               confused.

               The closest hiding place was the well's wall, but there could hardly be a worse 
               place to hide given that her father and uncle might climb over it at any moment. 
               Azoic's hut was still full of pigs and chickens, and they would immediately be 
               disturbed by her presence.

               She was forced to run behind the storehouse itself, but there 
               was not enough time. If she could just dive underneath it, 
               she might still remain undetected.

               As she rolled over into the sand, she was relieved to see it 
               was not Decimus, but the traders who were awake. The traders 
               were less likely to care about her disobedience.

               Fortunately, they did not seem to notice her. All three of 
               them were instead moving toward the storehouse doorway, so 
               they could all stare at Azoic. They were planning something, 
               perhaps preparing to kidnap Azoic while nobody was looking. 
               Whatever their wicked intentions might be, she did not like 
               the idea that they might have and intentions toward Azoic, 
               especially since they had become friends of Decimus.

               They were whispering. "The wagon is loaded and the mule is 
               hitched. So, what curse keeps us here?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       105.


               She crawled closer so she could hear them better, pushing 
               through sand-drifts which had piled up around the storehouse's 
               foundation pillars, blocking access any further hiding-spaces.

               The scuffing sound moved over her head, and she twisted 
               herself to achieve an uncomfortable view up through the 
               floorboards.

               A cock crowed. It would not be long before the sunny horizon 
               would make the space under these floorboards too bright for 
               this kind of spying. They might already be able to see her 
               if they looked down, but now was not the time to crawl further 
               into the shadows. She had to remain fixed in her discomfort 
               for fear of drawing their attention.

               "Ah, Servius, why are you always in a hurry? The Ixis are 
               not going to come looking for us out here, we have plenty of 
               time. You just let me do the thinking." Lucius had sung the 
               last phrase as if he were talking to a child.

               "Thinking? Is that what you call it? If we had listened to 
               you, we would still be out in the desert. Dead, most likely." 
               Servius' dropped onto one of the guest beds, which Decimus 
               must have set up in the storehouse specially for them. The 
               boards above Neariah's head creaked, and she felt sure Servius 
               was going to look down over the edge of his bed and see her.

               "Dead? Don't exaggerate. Getting lost was just a minor mishap. There was no 
               way I could have known the storm would follow us through the desert like it did.  
               But it's gone now, so what harm is done, Servius, my old friend? We have all the 
               food and liquor we could want. We have a comfortable place to sleep, and a bunch 
               of desert mice running around doing our laundry and cooking. All I'm asking is for 
               you to keep your mouth shut today so I can pull their tails when I'm ready."

               Servius was bouncing his dirty sandals over the edge of the 
               bed, leaving dark marks on the white bed sheets. She blinked 
               hard as dirt began to fall through the boards onto her face. 
               She frowned at him, wondering what her mother would say if 
               she knew this man wore shoes in bed.

               Servius groaned as if he was in pain. "Why do we bother with 
               all this. It's not a bank, Lucius, it's just a plain, old 
               store.

               There is no money anywhere in these buildings. That Decimus 
               idiot just calls it a bank because he wants to make an 
               impression.

               If you want to find out whether they have money, you have to 
               do more than pull tails off," she heard him make a snapping 
               sound. "So, why don't you let me be the cat this time. You'd 
               be surprised how co-operative your little mice will become. 
               They would be dying to give us anything we-"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       106.


               "Can't you see they are already doing everything we ask? You 
               lack subtlety, Servius."

               "And you are getting soft. Too many years in the mine, killing 
               roaches instead of-whoa, I was just joking, Lucey!"

               Lucius sandal ground into the boards directly above her, and 
               she could hear him grinding his teeth. His fat, shaking hands 
               looked ludicrous from below, but as he leaned forward, she 
               could hear Servius moving away, across the bed. "If you want 
               to see who's soft, I can show you."

               The smallest of the three strangers, Gnaeus, was scuffing 
               his sandals further away from her, and coughing nervously.

               Decimus continued to snore nearby, and she could hardly 
               believe such loud scuffling was not waking him up. Almost as 
               if Lucius had thought the same thing, the giant trader 
               suddenly moved over to the door to make an elaborate show of 
               checking for spies. He closed the door as if the tiniest 
               noise would now wake the entire village.

               Then Lucius rubbed his eyes. "Ah, Servy. Do you think people 
               would stay in this useless corner of nowhere if there was no 
               money to be made?  No, of course not. They have got to be 
               sucking the blood out of every trader who comes through here.

               You can see how many guest huts they had here, before the 
               storm blew them away."

               Lucius' laugh was a snort of derision. "Our good friend Decimus thinks he's going 
               to get at least a drachma for each night we stay in this hell hole, and I hate to think 
               what he might want to charge for the supplies we are taking. Yet, what trader 
               would argue with his prices when there is only one store in this whole, goddamned 
               desert? No, they have savings hidden around here somewhere. We just have to 
               find out where."

               "So if there is money, why don't we just kill a few mice-"

               "Servius, shut up! We don't need any more killing. It's like 
               leaving footprints that don't blow away. The Ixis would know 
               it was us. Besides, these mice have eyes and ears everywhere.

               Remember how they found us when we could barely even see 
               each other anymore? There is more of them in every oasis in 
               this desert. If we kill one of them, we might have to kill 
               all of them."

               "So? I could kill everyone here on my own." "No, these mice 
               trust us, which is why they will show us where their cheese 
               is. This time, instead of killing the mice, we just have to 
               place a mouse-trap."

               Lucius began pacing up and down directly along Neariah's 
               body, which made it difficult to hear what he was whispering.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       107.


               The nervous man in the far corner moved closer, stretching 
               his chin out toward her and twitching his lips as if plagued 
               by an uncontainable appetite.

               Lucius said, "Suppose we lost a very valuable treasure, like 
               this." He was throwing a rectangular frame from hand to hand.

               "That is from one of those pictures we got at the guard-house, 
               right Lucius?" Gnaeus screwed up his rodent-sharp face. "But, 
               if it's busted, how can it still be valuable?"

               "Of course it is not valuable, it never was. It is a fake. 
               You know that, and I know that, but these mice would not 
               recognize gold if it bit them in the eye. You saw how they 
               stared at the junk we had in the wagon. They probably think 
               anything shiny is worth something." Lucius' pretended to 
               bite the frame, although this only made Gnaeus look more 
               confused. "Suppose this valuable item was stolen from us."

               "And the punishment for theft will be-"

               Servius' voice stopped abruptly when Lucius leaned closer, 
               and this time Lucius' whole body was shaking. There was a 
               moment of silence, before Lucius continued. "Then, suppose 
               it turns up in a mouse-hole."

               "How did it get there, Lucius?" Gnaeus was wide-eyed.

               "And then, suppose their cheese goes missing too, and wouldn't you believe some 
               little piece of said cheese turns up in the same mouse-hole where we find this 
               treasure. And then, we are so upset about all this stealing, we leave this hell-hole 
               with our noses in the air, and the remainder of their cheese in our pockets."

               "And when in this plan do you expect to find out where all 
               their cheese is hidden?" Servius did not sound impressed.

               "Leave that to me. All I need is a little more time with my 
               new friend, Decimus."

               "You also need a mouse-hole in which to plant that treasure, 
               the hole of a really stupid mouse."

               "Mouse?" Gnaeus was rubbing his forehead.

               Lucius smiled again, "Aye, Gnaues, a mouse. Who will be our 
               stupid mouse?"

               "That guy doing the digging!" Gnaeus jumped across Neariah's 
               wedge of sight. "He was white and furry before he shaved. 
               Besides, the fat old maid said he lives in that hole out 
               there." The other two men looked at each other and laughed.

               "He did, honestly, you heard her talking about him. Decimus 
               hates the guy, so wouldn't he make a good...ah...mouse?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       108.


               "Yes, you get the idea, Gnaeus." Lucius' smile pushed his cheeks out into smooth, 
               red hemispheres. "But first, it may be time to find out who the stupid mouse really 
               is. I wonder whether he shaved so we would not recognize him."  Lucius opened 
               the door and slowly stepped out, with Gnaeus close behind. The strangers landed 
               in the sand very close to her, and she pulled in her elbows to make herself smaller.

               There was movement on the bed above as Servius also began to 
               follow. She was sure this stranger would not think twice 
               about killing her if he saw her, but she was forced to risk 
               detection. She needed to move her head so she could see what 
               Lucius and Gnaeus might be doing to Azoic.

               "Hello, are you the crazy man everyone talks about?"

               "Hmmm? Ah, me? Crazy?"

               "Are you? How nice for you. Yes, today is certainly going to 
               be a crazy day."

               "Yes, war."

               "War?"

               "Gods at war."

               "Oh, I see. Yes, of course. You are crazy, right?"

               "Compared with what?"

               "What?"

               "Hmmm, yes. Comparing is necessary. Sanity is relative."

               "What? I can't understand you. You sound foreign. Have we 
               ever met before? Where are you from?"

               "Up there." Azoic was staring up into the sky, and Neariah 
               smiled as she watched Lucius and Gnaeus shake their heads.

               Lucius stepped forward. "If you play games with me-" someone 
               in the well had sneezed loudly, and Lucius' voice continued 
               more quietly "-you will regret it."  He grabbed Azoic's tunic 
               and pulled Azoic away from the well.

               "What do they call you, crazy man?"

               "Azoic."

               "Azoic? Such a strange name, and not one to be easily 
               forgotten, is it? You remind me of somebody, somebody I did 
               not like. Do you know who that person might have been?"

               "Your father?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       109.


               Neariah stifled a gasp, convinced that Lucius was going to 
               hit Azoic for being so cheeky. Instead, Lucius relaxed his 
               grip and tilted his head back. "Why did you say that?"

               "He beat you, so now you fear people who do not fear you."

               Lucius' grip tightened again. "What the hell do you know 
               about my god-damned father? He was insane, just like you.

               Shut up, Gnaeus!"

               Gnaeus stopped giggling and retreated. Lucius' face was 
               shaking again, and she could clearly hear him grinding his 
               teeth.

               She could not believe Azoic's bravery.

               He looked so calm. He was staring back at Lucius with one of 
               his saddest expressions, as if he felt sympathy for the nasty 
               man. "Your father watches you and blames himself for what 
               you have become."

               "He does what? Yeah, of course he does. You are trying to 
               mess with my mind."

               "He forgives you for killing him."

               "What? Aaah! It is just a guess, just a guess! What in Hell's 
               Horde are you?"

               "Lucius?" It was her father's voice, echoing in the well. 
               Lucius pushed, causing both he and Azoic to step away from 
               each other. Her father's arm hooked over the side of the 
               well, and he peered up with a broad smile. "Lucius, I thought 
               I heard you.

               You are awake early. You met Azoic already?"

               "What? No. Yes. Azoic and I were just discussing Erebus, yes 
               Erebus!"

               "Oh, did you know each other in Erebus?"

               "Ah, we are not sure. Why do you ask?"

               "I'm sorry. I keep thinking people in Erebus all know each 
               other. Cities are not like villages, are they? However, if 
               you could tell us something about Azoic, it would be very 
               helpful."

               Her father lifted himself to sit on the wall, where he rubbed 
               his neck as if he was having trouble straightening it. "Azoic 
               has problems with his memory, as I suppose Decimus has already 
               told you by now."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       110.


               "Memory problems. How...inconvenient."

               "Yes, it is." Her father was squinting at Lucius. "Do you 
               know anything about Azoic?"

               Lucius shook his head. "No, I never saw him before."

               "I see." Hushah hesitated. "Ah, Lucius? How did you get out 
               of Erebus if the Ixis were preventing people leaving?"

               "Oh, we weren't actually inside Erebus. We were on our way 
               there, but we saw the fire and came this way instead."

               "When we first met, in the desert, you told me you had come 
               from Erebus." Her father was looking at the wagon, which had 
               a canvas sheet stretched over a very full load.

               "No, no. We picked up that load from a depot outside of 
               Erebus."  The cock crowed again as it marched out of Azoic's 
               hut, and Lucius rubbed his hands together. "And that sound 
               means it must be time for breakfast. We have a long journey 
               to get ready for. It was nice speaking with you, Mr. Hushah."

               Neariah stiffened as Lucius and Gnaeus started walking toward 
               her. The strangers were suddenly surrounding her, and the 
               top of the rising sun was bleeding out across the desert.

               She would be easy to see, especially if the one they called 
               Servius looked through the floor-boards.

               "I don't want you to talk to that one, he's trouble. Are you 
               carrying a knife? Good, keep it hidden. No killing unless I 
               say so. We may need to get out of here in a hurry, and if we 
               do...."

               The rest of Lucius' hushed instructions were lost to her as 
               the strangers stamped over her head and then moved away toward 
               Decimus' bedroom.

               Something was scuffing above her, and she looked up. Servius 
               was looking down and leaning his head to one side. Then his 
               knee slammed into the plank above her eye, and his shadowy 
               eye arched down toward her. She pulled her face away from 
               the crack in the boards by shuffling sideways, knowing there 
               was little hope she had evaded detection.

               There was a grunt, and then more scuffs as the killer-stranger 
               started moving again. The sound of his sandals on the steps 
               compelled her to keep pushing herself through sand, toward 
               the back of the storehouse, where she might get out and run 
               for the trees.

               "...lose something?" It was her father's voice, coming closer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       111.


               "Oh, Mr. Hushah. No, nothing important." She looked back to 
               see the killer-stranger's feet go back up the steps and she 
               heard him scuff toward Decimus' bedroom. She took a deep 
               breath to expel the fear, and then propelled herself out 
               onto the open sand behind the storehouse, where she stood 
               shaking sand out of her hair.

               What should she do now? The more she could learn about Lucius' 
               mouse-trap, the easier it would be to get the grownups to 
               believe her, but this was feeling more dangerous all the 
               time. How could she continue spying on them if one of them 
               already knew what she was up to? She could only imagine what 
               might happen to her if they caught her.

               The crawl space under Decimus' house was roomier, in fact it 
               was the boys' frequently-used den. The den was such a huge 
               boy-secret, so she had never been officially informed of its 
               existence. However, secrets only lasted so long in an oasis, 
               she had managed to discover its location with very little 
               effort.

               Her brother had modified part of the ornate skirt around the 
               base of Decimus' house so the skirt would pull open. It took 
               a frustrating moment to dig the skirt free from the sand 
               piled against it, while the sound of voices in Decimus' house 
               made the passages lying beyond far safer than sitting out in 
               the open.

               She crawled in to discover the den had become more extensive 
               than she remembered. She kept looking back to see if anyone 
               was following her, but she knew it was only her imagination.

               The further into the den's maze of passages she went, the 
               darker and smellier the passages became, and the less 
               comfortable she became. She continued to tell herself the 
               killer-trader was too big to fit into these small tunnels, 
               but even so, she started to scream when a hand grabbed her 
               ankle.

               "Ssshhh! Keep quiet or you will get us both into trouble. 
               What are you doing in here?"

               As slowly as she could, she exhaled the lung-full that had 
               almost been her downfall, then swallowed. "Merab, you almost 
               scared me to death. How did you know I was in here?"

               "Follow me."

               She remained too shocked to argue, but as she followed she 
               realized how grateful she was for his company. The darkness 
               no longer felt so threatening, and she might now have a 
               witness to back up her story when she explained everything 
               to their father. Suddenly Merab's heel was pressing into her 
               shoulder, as if he wanted her to stop. She was about to take 
               offense when she heard voices above them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       112.


               Merab wormed around to breath into her face, and he then 
               pointed upward. He showed two fingers, followed by a rapid 
               movement of hands and arms, which imitated two snakes striking 
               at each other. She bit her lip to avoid laughing at him.

               She supposed that he was in his element, there was not much 
               difference between a warrior and a spy. Given the 
               concentration that set his face, it was entirely possible 
               that he understood what was happening above better than she 
               did.

               He did not look surprised when more voices began to drift 
               toward them. This time he held up four fingers, and made a 
               cupping gesture with his hands. She shrugged in reply, and 
               he frowned at her, mouthing the words, "You are so useless."  
               Then he pressed his hands up against the boards, suffering 
               great pains to reposition his ear into his palms while 
               squinting at the tip of his nose like a newborn piglet.

               Again, she bit her lip, this time hiding her smile by 
               following her brother's example. Despite her misgivings, the 
               conversation above became much easier to overhear.

               "...but Lucius, we have to punish the offender. I can't allow 
               this sort of thing to ruin the good reputation of Summerdale. 
               I hardly know what to say, this is all just so very awful, 
               and I, I, I really don't know what to say."

               "Please, Mr. Mayor, it is not any fault of yours, nor any fault of your wonderful 
               town, here. One evil person in a town does not make the whole town evil, at least 
               not usually.  Let us forget-oh, the fireplace?  Oh, I see. How ingenious. I would 
               never have thought of looking under that mantle-and a real safe as well! I thought 
               that-well of course, you are a banker, are you not? What else should I expect? I 
               bow to you, sir. Truly, you are a master at work!"

               "Oh, yes, this is a simple thing. I designed it myself, so 
               it would look less like a safe, and more like, well, a 
               fireplace. I don't normally show it to my clients, though. I 
               place you under the strictest confidence in this matter. My 
               bank is just one of the many assets that will become more 
               important as Summerdale grows to become a town. I have great 
               plans.

               "For example, Summerdale sits on a subterranean river, which 
               feeds all the lakes along the Oasis Trail. I intend to build 
               a grand wall around this oasis, and perhaps even brush out 
               the sand to expose firmer footing, maybe even bare soil like 
               the gardens they used to have in Erebus. Then there is my 
               future Town Hall, high above the lake, built on long stilts, 
               with a long bridge leading up to it. Imagine it, a Town Hall 
               that will appear to be floating on water, at least during 
               the rainy season. Then I will build a great-"

               "But there is no money in there, ah, ahem-" Lucius continued to clear his throat 
               for much longer than seemed necessary "-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       113.


               Sand in my throat. Tell me, Mr. Mayor, Sir, do you perhaps have another safe?"

               Decimus' voice wavered. "No, this is my only safe."

               "Then where, pray tell, are all of your clients' savings?"

               "Oh, I see. No, no. I see why you are so-don't worry, you 
               are my only client-at the moment, that is. Usually the entire 
               village's savings are kept in here, but we had some unexpected 
               expenses last year-not theft or anything like that, no, never, 
               no!  There is no need to worry about that, Lucius, but I 
               feel it is my duty as a banker to tell you of our proud 
               achievements. We had over two thousand drachmas saved up in 
               this safe. Yes a healthy sum wasn't it? I can see you are 
               impressed. Hah, indeed.

               "I managed the savings plan myself of course, but then, last 
               year, Spurius-who you met earlier-one of my many employees, 
               yes, anyway; Spurius rented a street-front accommodation 
               from the Ixis. I had instructed him to set up a depot there, 
               like some of the other traders that come through here, except 
               that I was going to do it all on a much more professional 
               scale, of course.

               "It was all my own idea, I'm afraid to have to say. Yes, it 
               is so difficult to get anyone to appreciate the value of 
               commerce like you and I do, Lucius. I sometimes think my 
               poor villagers are lacking the basic sense we more civilized 
               persons must continually set as an example-"

               Lucius coughed politely. "Certainly, you flatter me by 
               comparing my meager achievements to your own great plans, 
               but, pray tell, the savings?"

               "Oh, they were all used up as a deposit on a street-front 
               accommodation, which has since burned down because of the 
               fires. I will have to start again from nothing. Fortune did 
               not smile upon me-or Summerdale."

               "Mr. Mayor, I am deeply saddened. No savings. Hell! No savings-
               by which I mean to say that our own savings are also much 
               depleted, so I can easily understand your predicament.

               We too ran from the fires with the remains of our trading 
               practice. We are in the same position, you and I."

               "I guessed as much, Lucius, that is why I am telling you all 
               of this. I want to finish our discussion about that business 
               proposition I made to you. My employee, Spurius, has become 
               rather-how should I convey this? Spurius always seems so 
               frustrated lately.

               He was obviously not adequately prepared for the demands of city life, and I should 
               not have sent him to Erebus on such an important mission. He got mixed up with 
               shipping silly little things like cannabis sativa-totally against my instructions, I might

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       114.


               add!  "Unfortunately, Spurius was the only one who was prepared to live in Erebus-
               not that it is an unpleasant place, of course, but compared to life in an oasis.... 
               Anyway, he was all I had to send, and the village was growing so very slowly, you 
               see, so I could not wait any longer. Yourself, however, with your trading experience 
               and your more gentlemanly presence, I'm sure....

               No savings? Lucius, my dear man, what are you saying?"

               "Savings? Oh, I was thinking aloud, forgive me. We really 
               ought to be leaving, the wagon is repaired and-"

               "But wait, we have much to discuss-"

               "Let's discuss it later, when we come back through this-"

               "And there is an amount outstanding, let me see now. Here, 
               an amount of some size, I should do a tally-"

               "We will be able to pay you out of the profits we are going to make from selling 
               our shipment in the mountains. We really don't have any actual coinage to pay 
               you with, since that too went missing during the storm. However, I will be returning 
               this way. I have to visit my poor dying father in Erebus, and I will be bringing my 
               trade profits back with me, so we could settle up any outstanding debts at that 
               time."

               "Oh, I'm sorry to hear of your father-nineteen, twenty, twenty-
               two-"

               "And we would be more than glad to help you out with that 
               crazy man, as we discussed earlier."

               "What? Oh, you mean taking him away with you? Yes, ah, that 
               would be very helpful, Lucius. Yes, he should leave as soon 
               as possible, but he should also be made to apologize and 
               account for stealing your trade assets out of my-"

               "Oh no, that would not be necessary, Mr. Mayor, Sir.

               Forgiveness is a famous virtue of the desert-folk, and we 
               would wish to replicate your graciousness, Mr. Mayor, Sir."

               "Forgiveness? Yes, well I suppose an apology might be 
               difficult to extract anyway, but if he proves difficult to 
               expel....

               I don't suppose you would know where he hid your treasure 
               after he stole it, would you?"

               Merab had been pulling at her shoulder, but by the time she 
               managed to turn around all she could see were his heels. 
               Since she had no desire to be left behind in the dark, on 
               her own, she decided to follow him. As she pulled herself 
               out through Merab's secret exit, he grabbed her by the arm 
               and said, "So, what did the crazy man steal?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       115.


               She blinked in the morning sunlight. "Azoic doesn't steal."

               "I spent all of yesterday digging that stupid well for your 
               stupid friend, and now he goes and steals something. Perhaps 
               it is best if they take him away."

               "Merab, how can you say that? It is just a trick, so Lucius 
               can do the stealing, and then blame Azoic."

               "Steal what? Decimus has already given him everything in 
               Summerdale worth more than a pinch of sand on a windy day.

               What is there left to steal?"

               "Neariah! Merab! Come here!"

               It was their father, and Merab shrugged his 'nobody can help 
               us now' gesture. They both walked toward the well, on which 
               their father and uncle were sitting side by side, covered in 
               mud and sweat. This reminded her that she had not dusted the 
               sticky sand off her once-clean nightshirt.

               "You did a nice job on the well, Daddy." She smiled as cutely 
               as she could. "Where is Azoic?"

               "Down under. Where have you two been?"

               "We were just playing, right Merab?" She heard Merab groan, as if he was in no 
               mood to support her. In fact, his expression looked quite hostile. Any confidence 
               she might have had, with him as a back-up witness, was now beginning to 
               evaporate.

               "Look at the two of you. Your mother is going to be angry 
               with you for not staying in bed until morning. How are we 
               are going to tell her you were also playing under Decimus' 
               house? You know you are not supposed to do that. So? What do 
               you have to say for yourselves?"

               She took a deep breath. "Lucius was going to kill Azoic if 
               he didn't tell him who he was, and the other one wanted to 
               kill everyone because Azoic looks like a mouse, and they 
               want to blame him for stealing their treasure when he didn't 
               do anything-but there aren't any savings so he isn't going 
               to come back to visit his father-he was lying, he is going 
               to kill Azoic instead. We can't let them take Azoic away, 
               he'll die if we don't try to-"

               "Wait, slow down a little! I can only hear so fast. Now, 
               what did you say?"

               She erupted again, and more scattered bursts of explanation prevented her from 
               answering her father's questions. Only when she realized how carefully her father 
               was listening was she able to take a deep breath and ease herself into a more 
               composed burst.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       116.


               After she had finally stopped talking she was in tears, and 
               her father was pacing around the well with a finger and thumb 
               wrapped around his patch of chin bristles. He stopped in 
               front of Spurius; they looked at each other, and then her 
               father stuck his chin forward and rasped his fingernails 
               under his neck.

               "Who else knows this, Neariah?"

               "No one, except Merab. He was there too, but he didn't hear 
               all of it. I'm scared now." She could feel her teeth pinching 
               into her lip, but the pain was not enough to stop the crying.

               "Possum." Her father put his hands on her cheeks and gently 
               shook her head. "Grown-ups say strange things sometimes.

               Things they don't always mean. Now, I'm sure you heard what you heard, but there 
               is probably more to find out than a few words. I think you should leave this matter 
               with me. In the meantime, I want you both to stay out of the crawl spaces from 
               now on. It is very impolite to spy on people, and you should both stay in your 
               bedrooms for the day as a punishment."

               Merab slapped at the dirt on the back of his pants. "Oh, 
               great.

               Now look what I get for helping you!"

               There was a cry from within Decimus' house. "Oh my goodness, surely it was not 
               worth so much?"  The anguished voice burst out into the daylight as a distressed 
               Decimus propelled himself toward them. His face was glowing red, and his head 
               was thrown back as he strutted, like an irate, fan-head lizard, rearing up to defend 
               its territory. "And it was stolen while in the safe-keeping of my bank!" He was 
               shouting at the top of his voice.

               Lucius was ambling along after Decimus, his face showing 
               excruciating pain, and he was waving his arms almost as 
               dramatically as Decimus. "Please, Mr. Mayor, Sir. Someone of 
               your position in life does not need to worry about something 
               this unimportant."

               "Oh, but I knew something like this would happen before we 
               saw the last of that crazy man. I'm so sorry it had to happen 
               to you, Lucius. I'm sure we will get to the bottom of this, 
               don't you worry. This has never happened before in all my 
               days as an Elder here."  They continued to run, the thin one 
               in mincing steps and the fat one in slow bounds, toward 
               Azoic's guest hut.

               Neariah watched in shock, as the two men both tried to squeeze 
               into the village's smallest hut. This started a chorus of 
               squeaks and squawks as pigs and chickens were evicted.

               "Ahah!" Lucius round posterior was the first to retreat back out of the hut, and he 
               turned around to display a gold picture frame, which he was holding delicately 
               between two of his

                                                                       117.


               stubby fingers. He waved it ceremoniously and called up to the distant sky, "Here 
               Mr. Mayor, Sir, I found it! I thank you so much! What would we have done without 
               this? It is worth as much as our whole shipment put together, and we owe you 
               more than we can say! And of course, this is but a minor discomfort between 
               friends. I truly did not want to burden you- or anyone else. Please, let us not make 
               an issue out of this terrible ordeal. Let us just forget the whole embarrassing, 
               dreadful, dishonest incident. Please accept this treasure as a token of our-"

               Decimus was not listening. He had already launched himself 
               toward her father and uncle, but despite his hurry he was 
               able to stop and wait as other villagers came running out.

               Lucius caught up with him. "You should keep this precious item in a safe place, 
               Mr. Mayor. I'm sure your bank would be just the place. Perhaps you could look 
               after it for us, while we are gone." Lucius then leaned over and whispered 
               something in Decimus' ear.

               "Collateral?" Decimus did not seem to be agreeing, but Lucius 
               continued to whisper in his ear.

               "Yes, yes of course." Decimus dropped his voice to a whisper.

               "Come into the bank, we need to sign your tally."

               "No, there is no need for that. I trust you explicitly, Mr.

               Decimus, kind Sir. We ought to be on our way. Thank you for 
               everything you have done for us, you have been most generous."

               The traders' wagon began to creak as the killer-trader started 
               to pull at the mule, while staring at Neariah as if he knew 
               what she had been saying about them. She moved closer to her 
               father to stare back at the killer, defiantly.

               Decimus shouted again. "But you can't leave, not without 
               Azoic. Where is he?"

               Her father and uncle both shrugged at Decimus at the same 
               time, and she deliberately kept her gaze away from the well, 
               while pursing her lips.

               "You have to wait until we find Azoic!" Decimus was imploring 
               Lucius.

               "Mr. Mayor, we would be pleased to take him along with us, 
               but Mr. Hushah has been objecting and we wouldn't want to 
               cause any ill feelings, now would we? So we must bid you 
               farewell, and thank you for everything." Lucius promptly 
               turned and walked away, lumbering along behind the wagon.

               "Wait! What about our agreement, the matter of, ah, Mr.

               Lucius? Just a moment, if you would!" Decimus ran up beside Lucius, and managed 
               to keep pace by walking sideways on his

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       118.


               ungainly legs. Then he stopped, with long arms outstretched toward Lucius' back.

               A large crowd of villagers had now emerged from their homes, 
               and they were watching in silence as Decimus began walking 
               back toward them. Neariah could see pain in Decimus' face, 
               as if he had just suffered a mortal wound.

               For the first time, she realized Decimus might actually have 
               lost an argument. Azoic was still here, the well was almost 
               finished, everyone was learning to like Azoic, and Decimus 
               looked like he had nothing left to say.

               They could send her to her bedroom now if they wanted, but she would still have 
               won. She did not care if Decimus saw the smile on her face, a smile she was 
               pleased to stretch from ear to ear.

               Decimus came very close to her, before he stopped looking at 
               her and instead faced her father. "We had already decided 
               the crazy man was going to leave with Lucius. You are 
               deliberately obstructing our policy. Where is the evil man?"

               There was a wheezing sound in the well, and Decimus looked 
               surprised to see Azoic leaning over the well's wall. "Get 
               out of there, immediately!"

               Then Decimus turned to her father and said, "He either leaves 
               now, or he finds his own way to Everdale the same way he 
               found his way here, on foot!"

               The smile left Neariah's face, and her jaw fell open. Beside 
               her, Azoic slid over the neat wall, leaving dark brown streaks 
               on its gray-white cement. He was wet up to his knees, but he 
               looked pleased. "There is water. Good for growing a village."

               Decimus whirled around furiously. "What do you know about 
               growing villages, fool! I was here before you even knew what 
               an oasis was, assuming you know what anything is," he added.

               Decimus bent down to bring his sharp nose into Azoic's face.

               "You have tricked us for long enough, and now we know you 
               are just a common thief!"

               "Must you hate me because I am older than you?"

               "Oh, no. You are not older than me. Look at you, you look 
               like a child. A child who steals!"

               "Age can make Elders, but it does not always give them an 
               Elder's wisdom."

               "What?" Decimus recoiled with equal surprise. "Of course age 
               is wisdom. What could that have to do with anything? I hate 
               you because you steal. In return for all we have given you, 
               you steal! It is time for you to leave, thief!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       119.


               "Hmmm, a thief, stealing pride?"

               Decimus turned his back on Azoic and produced the picture 
               frame from within his tunic, just as Lucius had done moments 
               ago. "The crazy man stole this!" He waved the frame around 
               in the air for everyone to see. "Lucius did not want me to 
               say anything, but you should know that the crazy man went 
               through the traders' belongings, and this is one of the things 
               he stole.

               He stole it from within the bank! We found it in his hut! He is a thief!"  There were 
               some mutters of disbelief, and Decimus began looking at faces with widening 
               eyes, as if he was becoming afraid of everyone.

               Then her uncle stepped down from the wall and plucked the 
               picture frame from Decimus' hand. He examined it, with his 
               jaw muscles flexing, and said, "Azoic, tell us, why did you 
               steal this?" Neariah could see the veins on her uncle's head 
               bulging, but he was looking at Decimus while speaking to 
               Azoic.

               Azoic wheezed heavily and shook his head. "Hmmm. I do not remember stealing 
               it. I am sorry. I should go now."  He wheezed some more, his sorrow evident in his 
               naked face, and in the distant gaze that pulled his sadness out toward the horizon, 
               like a lost soul.

               "So, Decimus. It is Azoic's word against Lucius', and this 
               is the only evidence we have." Spurius held the frame closer 
               to Decimus' nose, and waved it between their fiercely locked 
               eyes.

               Then he twisted the frame between his fingertips, delicately 
               forcing it to snap in half.

               "Ooops," he said, as the two pieces of broken wood fell to 
               the ground at Decimus' feet. "And it was so valuable; but I 
               could always buy you another one, next time I am in Erebus, 
               working like a slave for your own personal trading business, 
               Master Decimus!"

               Decimus lifted his nose. "Since you have been in Erebus you 
               have forgotten everything I taught you about good manners!"

               He pushed Spurius backward, there being no other way for him 
               to walk out of the circle of onlookers, and Spurius reacted 
               like a wounded dingo.

               Spurius pushed back with ferocity; her father stepped in between them and shouted 
               at her uncle; Decimus commanded everyone to control both her uncle and her 
               father; Ginnetho grabbed Spurius' arm; Decimus lifted his foot to kick at Spurius, 
               and then her father shouted louder than she had ever heard him shout before.

               "What is happening to us?" They all stopped moving. "Look at 
               us! We don't settle disagreements like this. We are acting 
               like crazy people. This is why we have-"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       120.


               "An Elder?" Spurius finished the sentence off for him, without 
               realizing why Hushah had stopped talking.

               "Oh, Hushah!" Moserah was leaning against the wall of the 
               well. "Azoic fell, straight backward, head first!"

               Hushah jumped over the wall and the snap of breaking pegs 
               echoed as he descended. Moserah reached into the well as if 
               she was trying to catch Hushah. Then she looked around as 
               his voice echoed upward, "Moserah, send down the lantern!"

               Ginnetho threw the lantern to her. She shook it and shouted 
               into the darkness, "It's empty! I'll get another one!"

               "Hushah, can you feel where he is?" Spurius was now climbing 
               down the well to join Hushah.

               Neariah's thoughts seemed to have detached themselves from her body, as if she 
               was watching the events as ghosts might watch people. Her legs must have carried 
               her through the crowd with a will of their own, because she had not intended to 
               arrive at the wall, or to press her forehead up against it.

               There were grown-ups running around behind her, but all she 
               could see was Azoic's wall. She could feel the hair on her 
               scalp crawling, and her head felt empty, as if all warmth 
               had just been pulled out of it.

               They were shouting at her uncle, who was now at the bottom 
               of the well. They were warning each other about a lantern 
               that was about to be dropped. There was shouting, up and 
               down, guesses about what could or could not be seen, and 
               then her uncle's echoed cry silenced everyone, "He is not 
               breathing!"

               She knew he was not breathing, she could feel it.

               "What about a pulse?" There would be no pulse, either.

               "Do you need water?"

               "Can you lift him?"

               A white sheet, which someone had once rolled into a swansized 
               ball, was being thrown down the well. Then there was silence 
               as everyone waited.

               She stepped back to make room for the sheet-covered object 
               as it rolled over the wall in front of her. Without any human 
               dignity, the object appeared completely alien. She tried to 
               imagine Azoic sleeping inside it, but the image would not 
               warm the coldness in her mind.

               "Is that Azoic?" A voice asked from behind her, as if the owner of this voice had 
               also been listening to her thoughts. She heard herself say that it was not, but that 
               if it was,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       121.


               he was probably just day-dreaming again. She was also about to explain that 
               angels could not die, but her own voice seemed to become as far away as the 
               other voices around her, so she allowed it drift into nothingness.

               Her mother's face filled her view, and then she felt air 
               being squeezed out of her as her chin was pressed into her 
               mother's shoulder. She hung as limply as the dead swan that 
               she had once rescued, and still staring at its carcass, she 
               was carried away from it.

               Then she was looking down at the white sheets of her own bed, and much fussing 
               was going on around her. People were providing her with soup and then taking it 
               away again, and people were whispering and patting her head and cheeks; poking 
               and prodding.

               She could barely feel it anymore. The drifting faces seemed to be part of the dream, 
               even when one of the faces appeared to be her brother's. This face would also 
               have escaped focus if it had not been for its unusual expression, a face that had 
               become quite distorted, like a frightened bilby-mouse. She examined her brother's 
               face briefly, before returning to the places where her thoughts could flow more 
               easily, where stories conjured up magical worlds beyond the desert.

               "...stop opening your eyes. We are traveling through the 
               stars, remember. Yes, there are little lights flashing past 
               us like fireflies, and ahead of us is another magical place, 
               where the rock-creatures sing."

               "Rock-creatures?" She had been most intrigued by that one.

               "Rocks, like this rock?" She had patted the ceiling of their 
               little cave within the butte.

               Outside, the rain was hammering into the sand as if the desert 
               was being boiled alive. Azoic had told her that Summerdale 
               would recover, because Nature always heals, so she was not 
               worried as they hid from the storm.

               "Life does not always look like you or I, my little Warlady.

               Incredible pressures and temperatures feel good to rock creatures, so they live 
               deep down, inside planets, without light or air, eating minerals. Some creatures 
               eat basalt, and use hydrogen gas for energy, and extract carbon from inorganic 
               carbon dioxide, while living in streams of acid, toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, 
               kerosene-"

               "You aren't making sense again."

               "Sorry. Ah, primordial organosynthesis can initiate in 
               millionyear old meteorite fragments that have endured absolute 
               thermovoids and alpha spectrum radiation. The definition of 
               life is not-"

               "What about the rock creatures? What did they look like?"

               "Hmmm?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       122.


               "I don't know how to imagine such weird things, Azoic. How 
               do you invent these things?"

               "I saw them, as I see them now. The rocks used to talk by 
               pulsing quantum-luminosity. Long, curly thoughts that could 
               dig through light-years like the wings of a nova."

               "The rock creatures had wings? What happened to your wings 
               when you fell from-"

               "-but these thought-creatures did not need physical wings.

               These thoughts were lighter than air. When they touched their 
               destination they would hiss. Psssshhhh."

               She had laughed at this-Azoic had looked so funny as he had blown air through 
               his wild beard. When he had opened his eyes, she had been quick to close her 
               own, to demonstrate that she was meditating as instructed. With her eyes closed 
               she had then asked, "How can anything be lighter than air?"

               "Air is quite heavy. You just don't think about it that way.

               Just like fishes don't think about how heavy a bucket of 
               water is. Oh, and there were the long fishes of Alphadatum.  
               They used to chase their tails in circles until they were 
               dizzy, and then they would go to sleep in frozen lakes, using 
               their long legs to-"

               "Fishes don't have legs." She had been quite adamant about 
               that one.

               "Have you seen all the fishes there are to see? No? So! The 
               fishes' had legs, which were-"

               "They would look really silly," she had giggled.

               "They probably felt sorry for the fishes without legs, the 
               ones that could not run through their life-game."

               "Like kick-stick?"

               "Kick-stick? I do not remember kick-stick."

               "It's easy, I'll show you tomorrow. They will find us 
               tomorrow, won't they?"

               "The fishes?"

               "No, silly-oh, but don't worry, Azoic." She had given him a 
               big hug, while only pretending to be confident. It seemed to 
               make Azoic feel better. "That wind will stop eventually. 
               Then I will take you home."

               "Neariah, did you ever see a squimble?"

                                                                       123.


               "A what?"

               "Can you imagine one as big as a person?"

               "But, I can't even imagine a small...swimble."

               "Ahhh, that is because your eyes are open. What do you think 
               it looks like?"

               She shut her eyes. "Well, I suppose it would have to have 
               long legs, and maybe a wiggly nose that digs in the sand-"

               "So you have seen a squimble!" Azoic had looked very concerned 
               about this-he was so very weird sometimes.

               "Can we talk about...something else?"

               "Hmmm?"

               "There was a question I have been meaning to ask you, but....  
               it's just that I don't want to know the answer if it is bad."

               "What kind of answer would be good?"

               "Heaven. That would be a good answer."

               "Oh, I see. Hmmm. Only the bravest should search for truth 
               where there are good and bad answers."

               "So, does that mean you are going to say Heaven?"

               "Heaven."

               "After I ask the question, silly."

               His bushy eyebrows had risen, as if he had wanted her to 
               smile, but she was not going to be distracted. "Here is the 
               question." She had taken a deep breath. "Did Crazymutt go to 
               Heaven, or to Hell?"

               He had tilted his head to one side, and his eyebrows had 
               come down so low that she could hardly see his eyes in the 
               poor light. "Why do you ask?"

               "Decimus said only people can go to Heaven, and only if they 
               believe what he tells us to. He said if dogs had souls, then 
               why wouldn't mosquitoes go to Heaven? He said God made man 
               in his image, and God does not look like a mosquito."

               "Perhaps Decimus will be a mosquito in his next life."

               "Next life?" She had never imagined more than one life.

               "Some people believe their soul can return in new bodies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       124.


               Other people believe there are other places they can go when 
               their physical body dies. Some people believe there is only 
               one soul, shared by all of us, alive and dead, so there is 
               nowhere for the soul to go because it is always everywhere. 
               What do you believe?"

               "I don't really know. That's why I was asking you, Azoic.

               What is the truth?"

               "Some believe Heaven is where every mind comes from, and 
               goes back to, God's mind-share environment. If it is the sum 
               of all the minds in Nature, how can one natural mind ever 
               hope to imagine it? Yet if all minds eventually share each 
               other, within the shared soul, perhaps those who feel unworthy 
               of dissolving themselves into it must live again to learn 
               again."

               "That can't be Heaven. Yuck! I don't want to be turned into 
               soup and mixed up with other people, and I don't want anyone 
               else to know what I am thinking."

               "When seeking truth, faith is no longer about comfort or 
               what you prefer to believe. All you touch is energy, nothing 
               is as real as you think it is, we are all energy, so how can 
               you be separate?"

               "Does this mean Crazymutt is happy, or is he sad? What should 
               I believe?"

               "Your religion can take away your sight, and leave you 
               dependent upon those who do not know they are also blind. Do 
               not ask others what you should believe. Some answers you 
               must find in yourself, because they are too wonderful to be 
               said in mere words. Why else would Godstuff be so close and 
               yet so far? I must go." He had then leant forward, as if 
               preparing to leave.

               She had grabbed at his tunic. "You can't leave me here."

               "I will be back soon. I have to catch those who are blowing 
               away." His palm had warmed her forehead, and he had smiled 
               at her as if he wanted her to know he would never let anything 
               harm her. The things around her had slowly started to lose 
               their shape, dissolving into the background rock. Then 
               suddenly there was sunlight outside, and no more rain-it had 
               all dried up as if the night had flashed past instantly.

               She remembered blinking at the strange angular sand upon 
               which Azoic was walking, coming toward her, and she had asked, 
               "Did I fall asleep?"

               "Yes. I did not want you to be afraid, while I was gone. Did 
               you dream about Crazymutt?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       125.


               "Actually, I did."

               "So is he in Heaven?"

               "I don't know." She had marched out onto the crusty sand to 
               smell the cold air. "But I do know if I was God, I would 
               rather have Crazymutt in Heaven with me than Decimus."

               He had then asked her the strangest of questions. "Does this 
               mean you are still responsible for Crazymutt, or did you 
               give Crazymutt to God?"

               She had considered that question for a long time as they 
               walked back to Summerdale, before she finally found an answer.

               "That question you asked me about Crazymutt; well, I have 
               decided that Crazymutt must be in Heaven, because God loves 
               dogs too, doesn't he?"

               "People, dogs, mosquitoes, bacteria, ribonucleic acid, breaths 
               of air, grains of sand, and even Decimus, are all Godspawn, 
               and they are already part of God's soul because they share..."

               "...are you all right, Possum?" Her father was patting her 
               face with a corner of the bed sheet.

               She blinked. "I forgot to teach Azoic to play kick-stick."

               "I know, Possum." He put his arm around her shoulders and 
               pulled her sideways as she hid her face in his shoulder.

               "Is the well finished?" Her words were muffled and soggy.

               "No, but we will finish it very soon, I promise. It is going 
               to be a Remember Well. A special sort of well, so we can 
               always remember Azoic digging it."

               "Can I help you to finish the Remember Well?" She gritted 
               her teeth to hold back the tears and she was looking her 
               father in the eyes.

               "Yes, of course you can. Nobody is going to touch it until 
               you are better."

               "I'm better now. Are we are going to bury Azoic with a proper 
               ceremony, like we should have done for 'Mutty?"

               "Ah, yes, Crazymutt. Yes, we are going to bury Azoic."

               "Will Azoic's soul have to go to Heaven before he sees his 
               well being finished?"

               "I'm sure he will see it from Heaven."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       126.


               "But what if he can't?" The tears were streaming over her 
               cheeks again, even though her teeth were grinding together.

               Her throat burned from the effort of talking instead of 
               crying.

               She pushed aside the bed sheets as if they were to blame for her pain, and wiped 
               her face in the crook of her arm. Her father moved away as she slid off the bed. 
               He was slowly shaking his head but he did not speak as he followed her.

               Azoic was not where her uncle had left him, but several 
               villagers had collected together outside the storehouse, 
               which probably meant Azoic had been taken inside there. She 
               had to let her father reach up and untie the dangling bucket 
               for her, since she could not reach it. Then she began filling 
               it with the chips of rock, which lay scattered around the 
               well. No matter how gently she placed the chips in the bucket, 
               the silence around her was broken by the crash of each rock 
               hitting metal.

               When filled, the bucket was heavier than she had expected, 
               and the attempt to lift it made her wheeze, like Azoic had 
               used to do. Despite the awkward weight, she dragged the 
               contents onto the nearby rock pile, but refused to allow 
               herself to rest when it was done. No matter what everyone 
               was thinking about her, as they watched her from a distance, 
               she was going to finish Azoic's Remember Well.

               As she continued to labor, her father stepped into the 
               storehouse. He returned some moments later to resume his 
               work inside the well. Whatever he had said to everybody 
               resulted in the two of them being left uninterrupted until 
               mid-day, at which time the other villagers started to approach 
               in ones and twos, offering assistance.

               First came her uncle, then Ginnetho and Jaalam, and then 
               even her mother. Even Decimus came out and dusted the well 
               wall with his fingertips, which made her stop and stare at 
               him in surprise. His efforts did not last long, though, 
               because he walked away as soon as he noticed she was staring 
               at him.

               He was not the only grown-up who seemed uncomfortable when 
               they approached the well. They all moved slowly, as if they 
               were not sure they really wanted to get so close to it. Yet, 
               Neariah was in no mood to encourage them, she no longer cared 
               whether they helped or not. Instead, she concentrated on her 
               own work, pushing herself until every bone in her body ached, 
               and then she almost began crying again so she pushed herself 
               even harder.

               There was no celebration when her father brought up a cup filled with beautiful, 
               sparkling water. As she forced herself to swallow the offering, she noticed Decimus 
               was still watching her from his storehouse doorway. Again, he looked away and

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       127.


               retreated when she stared back, and again she wondered whether he would ever 
               admit to himself he could have been wrong.

               She inspected the empty cup with quiet pride. The water tasted 
               perfect. If only Azoic could have been here to drink it. In 
               her thoughts she sent a wish across the well to wherever 
               Azoic's soul might be, but she knew it was a silly wish. He 
               did not have a soul because he was an angel.

               She so desperately wanted him to wake up and climb out of 
               that sheet, but.... Oh, it was an impossible wish, but it 
               was only a wish.

               She knew God never gave back those He took away, but perhaps 
               angels were different. Anyway, they had finished the Remember 
               Well, and now nobody would ever forget Azoic had been a good 
               person.

               In her dreams that night, Crazymutt had been playing with Azoic. She had been 
               unable to join their game because there had been a huge white sheet in the way, 
               through which she could only see them as distant shadows. She had called out to 
               them, but she had been unable to gain their attention. It had been a horrible dream, 
               just as this was going to be a horrible day, like all days would be from now on.

               Today brought the burial ceremony she had asked for, and 
               they were going to put Azoic's body into the ground. She had 
               to keep reminding herself that Azoic was no longer inside 
               his body, so he would not suffocate under the sand. It was 
               just like burying a discarded garment, which made the whole 
               idea of a ceremony seem a little silly.

               She had asked her father if Azoic could be buried beside the 
               well, but he had not like that idea. She had figured out for 
               herself that a rotting body might poison the water, and she 
               could imagine how sad that would make Azoic, after all the 
               trouble he had gone to making the well in the first place. 
               She supposed Azoic would not care where his body was buried, 
               but even so, it was lonely out in the open desert.

               Lonely and hot. She was sweating in her best tunic, but Decimus was sweating 
               even more in his ugly, black robe. It was unlike anything she had ever seen, 
               although she suspected her uncle knew what it was. He seemed to be most irritated 
               that Decimus was wearing it.

               While everyone had been walking toward the burial site, her 
               uncle had asked Decimus whether he thought it was wise to be 
               wearing a robe. Decimus had just shrugged; he did not seem 
               to be as defensive as usual.

               The same sand that someone had dug out of the grave pit was now forming a 
               circular ridge of sand, surrounded the entire ceremony and everyone in it. Beside 
               the empty pit, Azoic was still wrapped in a white sheet that her uncle had called a 
               shroud, and the whole bundle was laid upon a hard wooden plank that seemed 
               far too narrow to be comfortable. Neatly coiled ropes lay at the corners of this plank, 
               so that it could be lifted without having to touch it, or Azoic's remains.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       128.


               They had each stepped respectfully upon the ridge as they 
               had entered the ceremony, leaving a deep footprint behind 
               them.

               So, this was the first opportunity she had been given to 
               look down into the grave-pit.

               It was a precarious rectangle, lined with large boards. As 
               more villagers stepped closer, fine filaments of sand began 
               pouring between the boards, slowly filling up the pit.

               Decimus began coughing and pulling at the stiff, white collar, 
               as if it was cutting his neck. "We are gathered today to 
               honor the passing of one of our own unto God."  He was 
               speaking in a slow, and somber drone that she expected to 
               become even more iritating to listen to than his usual speech 
               voice.

               "Azoic was a kind person. He played games with the children, 
               especially Neariah." Decimus nodded at her with a small smile, 
               but she refused to smile back.

               "Also, he built our new well, which Hushah has suggested 
               that we call the Remember Well, because there has been 
               something to remember here, and because Azoic had so few 
               memories of his own to remember.

               "Azoic came out of nowhere with nothing but a white sheet 
               wrapped around him, and that is all he has as he leaves to 
               go...ah...to wherever God permits. I have to admit that I 
               was....

               Ahem!" Neariah was now carefully examining Decimus out of 
               the corner of her eye. "I was wrong about Azoic." He shrugged 
               and looked around, pressing awkwardly at his white collar as 
               if was preventing his words from squeezing out.

               "Azoic brought the best and the worst out of us. No, it would be fairer to say that 
               he brought the best out of all of all of you, and the worst out of me. I was afraid 
               that I would look less like an Elder in the company of an older, and perhaps wiser, 
               man.

               So, I believed what I wanted to believe about Azoic. As it 
               turned out, he was harmless, and I was harmful.

               "When he tried to teach me about myself, I...I...I...." Decimus wiped his eye and 
               Neariah stared incredulously at the streak of wetness that remained on the back 
               of his hand. "I killed him."

               There was a long wait before Decimus could speak again. "I 
               am not fit to be the Elder of this village. I should leave 
               Summerdale, and someone else should conduct this ceremony."

               He turned to leave, but Spurius stopped him with a firmly placed forearm. "No. 
               You don't leave so easily."

                                                                       129.


               The veins on her uncle's scalp did not look as angry as his words sounded.

               "I pushed him too. We all pushed him. You are the Elder here, 
               and you are responsible for all of our actions. Your shame 
               is no greater than our shame, but as the leader of our faith, 
               it is your job to be the keeper of shame, we are bound 
               together by our shared conscience."

               "Do you think I am trying to run away from shame, Spurius? 
               Can't you see I am leaving everything I have ever dreamed of 
               here, because I am full of shame. I am not worthy. An Elder 
               should be wise, not just proud."

               "I never thought I would hear you say that, Decimus. Yet, saying it does not give 
               you an excuse to run away and hide. We are a village when we are together, and 
               nothing when we are apart. We can't all wander off alone, without forgiveness for 
               our guilt. You have to hold our shame for us, you have to learn to live with our 
               guilt, and you have to finish the ceremony. Say what we feel."

               Decimus cleared his throat several times before he could 
               raise his head and stand upright. His usual public posture 
               had clearly become less comfortable for him, because it bled 
               out of him as he resumed. "I was not Azoic's friend, I am 
               probably not the best to speak for whatto speak for...." 
               Spurius was squinting fiercely at him, which seemed to push 
               him back into an upright position again.

               "Yes. Azoic, a gentle man, who remembered little of his past.

               Hushah told me that he may once have worked in a garden, and 
               I must admit that I was filled with fear when I heard this, 
               although I choose not to tell any of you why. You see, gardens 
               used to be religious places in Erebus. I remember the speeches 
               I used to hear in them.

               "For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the 
               Rock of your refuge; therefore, though you plant pleasant plants and set out slips 
               of an alien god, though you make them grow on the day that you plant them, and 
               make them blossom in the morning that you sow; yet the harvest will flee away in 
               a day of grief and incurable pain. I quote Isaiah, chapter seventeen, verse ten.

               "Yes, the Ixis destroyed the gardens of Erebus, because they 
               were the places where the people went to listen to the 
               Priests.

               This robe that I wear here today was fashioned after those 
               of the Priests, and I used to give speeches also, but I was 
               never a real Priest. I just wanted to become one of them.

               "Then one night all the Priests disappeared, some said they went into buildings 
               deep underground. Others said they had all been murdered by the Ixis. We hid in 
               our homes, but too many people knew that we owned black robes, so we couldn't 
               live in Erebus anymore. The Ixis.... Well, I was young, and foolish, and all I ever 
               wanted was my own congregation. Summerdale was my-"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       130.


               "Decimus, can you please bore us with your sad history another 
               time? Today is for Azoic." The veins on her uncle's scalp 
               were bulging as if he was about to hit Decimus.

               "Uh, yes. I am sorry. Where was I? Yes, it was a great honor 
               for us to have Azoic with us, and indeed, he taught us much.

               We all learned how fearful we can be, unable to see past his 
               lack of history. We learned how unfriendly we can be, 
               especially toward someone who wished only for caring company.

               "Yes, he was in truth a special person. His unique way of 
               seeing, and of understanding, gave him a wisdom unlike that 
               of an Elder. He had a wisdom that we never really understood.

               The greatest shame I hold is that we never opened our hearts 
               enough to find that understanding.

               "What do we feel now? We feel his loss. We feel sadness that 
               one of our own has departed. We feel grateful for all that 
               he did for us, and we feel him leaving for Heaven, probably. 
               We will now feel silence as we remember."

               Everybody closed their eyes. Neariah chose to remember Azoic 
               telling her to have faith, and pacing with his divining 
               sticks, and falling in the lake....

               As they lowered Azoic into the grave, slowly and gently, 
               several villagers who thought they knew the burial tune hummed 
               in occasional melody. They each took their turn to shovel 
               their own footprint out of the circular ridge and into the 
               grave.

               Neariah, who was the last to do this, was not strong enough to heave the shovel 
               in this way, so instead she picked up her small footprint in her bare hands, and 
               walked back to the edge of the grave to drop it in.

               "Good-bye Azoic," she whispered quietly, so that no one else 
               would hear her. "I hope you and 'Mutty find someone else to 
               play with up in Heaven, someone who is better at looking 
               after you than I was. Don't let anyone up there bully you 
               around, and don't spend all your time staring off into 
               nowhere. It really is annoying, you know." She wiped her 
               sandy hands on her best tunic, and exhaled a breath that 
               fluttered out of her as if she was exhaling the soul of a 
               butterfly.

               "Ixis!" hissed Spurius, hatefully.

               She looked up in the direction that everyone else was looking 
               in. A formation of riders was coming straight toward them 
               from out of the heat-shimmers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       131.


               "What in the name of God could they want with us?" It was 
               Decimus who had asked this, and he moved to stand behind her 
               uncle, who replied, "I don't know, but let me do the talking.

               They are very aggressive people, so everybody must be silent 
               unless you are spoken to, and try not to do anything to 
               provoke them." His warning caused the women to pull the 
               children together, although Merab moved quickly to stand 
               beside his father instead.

               The soldiers spread out, but the one that seemed to be the 
               leader kept getting closer until his horse was almost 
               breathing on Decimus.

               "Is this Oasis One East? That would be Summerdale to you."

               The Ixis leader casually pulled out his sword and held it 
               unnecessarily close to Decimus' head. He was not looking at 
               Decimus, he was looking back at the Remember Well where some 
               other soldiers were now standing. "Is this everyone who lives 
               here?"

               "What can we do for you, Praefect Manius?" Her uncle was 
               stepping forward with a stiff smile across his face.

               "How do you know my name?" The sword lifted slightly, away 
               from Decimus and toward Spurius.

               "I recognize you, sir. You commanded the cleaning of Street 
               Ninety after the fires. The looters-"

               "Ah yes, I remember you. You were the messenger boy with the 
               burned head." The leader, Manius, leaned forward and stared 
               into her uncle's eyes. "How did you manage to leave Erebus, 
               messenger boy?"

               "I was thrown over the outer Ring-wall, with the dead, while I was unconscious. 
               When I awoke I started walking, in the dark, and then-" "And then you walked all 
               the way here."  He smiled. "Quite an impressive walk, wouldn't you say?"

               A rider had arrived beside Manius carrying a jug, and Manius 
               grabbed at it. Water poured onto his shoulders as he drank, 
               and then sloshed onto the sand as he shoved it back at the 
               soldier who had brought it. "Only when this oasis has been 
               searched, can the men drink," he instructed. The soldier 
               nodded and pulled his horse away.

               "So, messenger boy, you disobeyed the law, and ran away."

               He kicked savagely, urging his horse forward, but the horse pushed her uncle aside 
               and walked past him, into the ceremony circle, directly toward Neariah. She was 
               forced to step back from under the horse's frothing teeth, but she refused to move 
               out of its way. She was outraged that this ugly soldier was being so disrespectful, 
               yet she had also been frightened by her uncle's words about provoking Ixis anger.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       132.


               "Who is that hole for, little girl?" Manius was grinning at 
               her, but she refused to answer. He lifted his chin and spat 
               into the grave. "I said, who died?"

               Neariah put her hands on her hips and gave the soldier her 
               fiercest stare. "My friend! We are burying him. You are 
               interrupting our ceremony!"

               Manius looked back at Spurius with raised eyebrows. "She has 
               a sharp tongue for a child surrounded by Ixis soldiers."

               Spurius stepped into the circle and asked, "Surely you didn't 
               come here just to intimidate children."

               "Do I detect some sensitivity, messenger boy? Perhaps I should punish this child 
               for your transgressions."  He laughed to himself while he rode around looking at 
               the frightened villagers. "Have you seen anyone pass through here lately?"

               The point of Manius' sword swung into Decimus face, making 
               him jerk backward, gasping, "No, no traders. Er...not lately."

               Decimus looked at Spurius for help.

               "Are you searching for anyone in particular, Praefect Manius?" 
               Spurius asked.

               "What does this mean?" Manius slapped his sword against his 
               own chest, making a clunk that indicated the presence of 
               metal under the black material. A dust cloud rose from his 
               shoulder as he exposed a plate with a design pressed into 
               it.

               "This is a punctim, and it means I am a praefect for Acting- Legate Vibius, 
               understand? His legion is the most senior legion in the Ixis Empire, and I am a 
               praefect in it!  So, this village, this whole damned desert, now belongs to my legion. 
               You are beginning to annoy me, messenger boy."

               "That was not my intention, Praefect Manius."

               "Is this skinny man your village Elder, or do you do the 
               talking for this village?"

               "He is the Elder, but he doesn't know-"

               "I am not asking you what he knows, I'm asking you if he is 
               the senior authority here!"

               Spurius nodded, gritting his teeth and looking straight back 
               at Manius.

               "You, Elder! Name?"

               "Decimus, Sir."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       133.


               "Good boy. Now tell me, has anybody else visited you from 
               Erebus lately?"

               "Er...I don't think so."

               "You don't think so? Do you have trouble keeping up with the 
               traffic through here? Think harder!"  Manius rubbed his face 
               and sighed with exaggerated patience. "Outbound trade has 
               been halted for the duration of the present emergency 
               situation.

               You are aware of what is happening in Erebus, are you not?"

               He motioned toward Spurius.

               "Yes we heard a little-" Decimus began.

               "Good. Then you will understand that my legion now has 
               complete authority to represent the New Ixis Government in 
               all territories. That is why we can commandeer your supplies, 
               and that is why I can bury you all in that grave if I do not 
               get your utmost cooperation. I am looking for twenty prisoners 
               who escaped from Prison-Mine Two Four. They may be traveling 
               in small groups, they may be armed and they may be dangerous. 
               How many people have come here in the last month, who were 
               they, and how long ago?"

               Decimus was white faced and he stuttered at the beginning of 
               a sentence that was interrupted by one of the soldiers.

               "Sir! We found wagon tracks, leading east, freshly made!"

               "Yes, Decimus?" The tip of Manius' sword was resting on 
               Decimus' cheek.

               "Uh, there were three men, but they said they were traders.

               They had a wagon full of weapons that they said they were 
               going to sell to the Mountain People. They only stayed for 
               two nights, to repair their wagon. We didn't know they were 
               convicts, honestly!"

               "How am I supposed to believe you when your story keeps 
               changing, Decimus?"

               "But I am telling the truth, Praefect, Sir! I wasn't really 
               lying to you, I was-"

               "Too afraid to remember? Bah! You people disgust me, you have no spines!"  He 
               lifted his sword again and Decimus winced as he put his hand up to a line of red 
               that had been left on his cheek. "Oh, and now look. You have blood dripping onto 
               your robe, Decimus, and what an interesting robe it is too. Am I to suspect that 
               you might be practicing an illegal religion in this god-forsaken oasis?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       134.


               Decimus' arm moved higher up behind his back, and Neariah 
               noticed the ends of his white collar poking out between the 
               fingers of his fist.

               "I made it for him!" She heard herself shout. "And I designed 
               it. I used spare material that nobody wanted, and I thought 
               black was more appropriate for a funeral."

               "Is that so? You made it?"

               Her father stepped toward her, and pulled her close to his 
               legs. "Yes, she did. We have some cloth left over, which she 
               could use to repair your own uniform, for a small fee."

               "Ahah, that is funny. To let a child play with my uniform, and to pay for it."  Manius 
               looked up at the sky and laughed. "If I had my way, you would all be slaves of the 
               Ixis Empire, and you would soon learn the dangers of such insolence. Don't leave 
               that circular area until I tell you to."

               He tugged the horse away in a tight arc and galloped back 
               toward the village. They could hear him swearing angrily at 
               a large group of soldiers who were gathering around the well.

               Her uncle cursed quietly without moving his lips, and she 
               squinted in the same direction that he was looking. More 
               soldiers were riding out of the woods to join those that 
               were distributing items from the storehouse.

               Then the soldiers began to line up in a long row, which is 
               where they remained until Manius' again started riding back 
               toward them. Behind him, the soldiers seemed to move at the 
               same time, as if they were all tied together with invisible 
               ropes.

               As Manius approached, she realized that he was eating a piece 
               of dried meat, and speaking with his mouth full. "...which 
               is probably why that well is not on our map. Make sure the 
               new map is accurate before you send it to Legate Vibius." 
               Manius' horse stopped by Decimus.

               "If any other men come here I want you to send that messenger-
               boy to Everdale to inform us. We are setting up a camp there. 
               I warn you, do not help anyone without my permission."  He 
               smiled at Neariah. "You wouldn't help anyone, would you, 
               little wasp?"

               "I'll help who I like," retorted Neariah. She was now standing 
               behind her father's legs, but she was ready to give this 
               rude man a piece of her mind. "You are not nice!"

               Manius laughed sharply. "Nice is for weak people. Nice is not part of my job." He 
               yanked at his horse's reins. "My soldiers will be riding through here regularly!  If 
               these soldiers do not tell me nice things about you nice people, you will be digging 
               nice graves all over your nice village!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       135.


               If you annoy me, I will annoy you."

               I do not believe in an eye for an eye-" Manius winked at 
               Decimus, as if he was sharing a mutual secret "-I charge a 
               life for an eye."

               The long line of soldiers began to carve their horses straight 
               through the ceremonial circle, and some of the horses even 
               jumped over the grave. As each horse jumped, a shower of 
               sand sprayed into Neariah's eyes, but still she stood guard 
               over Azoic so he would not get stepped on. At one point her 
               father pulled her back and put his hand over her mouth so 
               she could not tell the soldiers what she was thinking.

               She could hear Decimus whispering something to Teacher Berea. 
               "...immune to damnation. They think their deliberate 
               indifference protects them from God, so they throw their 
               disdain at those who will not retaliate." He smiled self-
               consciously and nodded at her. She was not sure whether this 
               was to show his thanks for her protection, or whether he was 
               just embarrassed by his own mumbling.

               Teacher Berea had been pressing her lips together, as if she 
               was refusing to eat another mouthful of outrage, and now she 
               strutted off toward the village like an affronted sand grouse.

               Merab was still staring at the distant soldiers. "Wow. Those 
               were real Ixis soldiers!"

               "Decimus?" Teacher Berea had reversed direction and was now 
               approaching Decimus. "What was that he said about convicts? 
               You let convicts make fools of us!"

               "Father, do you think Azoic was a convict?" Merab had 
               interrupted their teacher's continuing exposition, which was 
               unusually reckless, but Merab seemed to be too excited to 
               anticipate the consequences. He was completely preoccupied 
               with jabbing his finger into the air, imitating Manius' sword.

               "Merab! There are ways to behave! This is a burial ceremony."

               Her father had addressed the whole village with this reproach, 
               but Neariah could see that her brother was taking it very 
               personally. He folded his arms so aggressively that he grunted 
               as his fists hit his stomach.

               "Yes, yes. The ceremony." Decimus shrugged at Teacher Berea, 
               and rubbed his face with his palms. "I'm sorry. Ah, yes, and 
               so we give up the soul of Azoic to God. Hushah, are you going 
               to do the filling?"

               Her father was frowning at Decimus and shaking his head 
               slowly, which she knew to be her father's way of expressing 
               profound disappointment. Decimus did not seem to notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       136.


               "Good. I now declare this man dead and buried. We should 
               have a meeting. Immediately."

               "We should have a meeting should we, Decimus? Should we have 
               a meeting in the the storehouse, or in the bank?" Spurius 
               had his arms crossed like Merab, but instead of hunching 
               forward, he was leaning back on his heels. "Since you went 
               to so much trouble to tell Lucius' group about our safe, we 
               should reconsider whether it is wise to have a bank at all.  
               Perhaps, if there are other convicts wandering around, we 
               should stop calling it a bank, and start calling it a home, 
               which is what it is, right? Your ever-expanding home.

               "I also think the storehouse is too small and uncomfortable 
               for meetings, so we should instead use Berea's Sabbath-house 
               from now on. More than that, I think that all these damned 
               meetings are getting a bit tiresome, and we should all be 
               able to talk to each other without preening our tail feathers 
               with formal policies!"

               "Oh, Spurius. Let Decimus have his meeting." Her father was 
               still shaking his head. "Let's not argue any more. Decimus 
               is too old to change his ways now."

               "Where does it say that Elders cannot learn?" Her uncle was 
               red-scalped and determined. "Decimus should be put in his 
               place, even if it takes years to re-train him!"

               "Indeed," Decimus said. "Spurius has spoken his feelings and 
               I agree with him. In fact, it would be wise to distribute 
               the possessions stored in my b-ah-home. We should hide 
               whatever they do not take, in case we have more Ixis 
               visitors."

               Her uncle pointed toward Summerdale. "Hide them? In an oasis? 
               Damn it, Decimus. Where do you expect to hide them in an 
               oasis?"

               "In the Remember Well?" Neariah suggested, whispering to 
               avoid her uncle's anger. Then she wondered why she was again 
               protecting Decimus, when Decimus so desperately deserved to 
               be chastised.

               Her uncle continued as if he had not heard her. "Perhaps you 
               should have bartered for some of those weapons that your 
               friendly business partners were carrying with them. We may 
               need weapons soon, or is your business partner going to bring 
               them back again, when he returns to Erebus to visit his dear, 
               old, dying father?"

               "Did Lucius tell you about our discussion?" Decimus looked 
               around at the faces staring at him, until he met Merab's 
               eyes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       137.


               Merab had been grinning at Spurius and waving his arms as if 
               he was cheering on a race, but he fell silent as Decimus 
               said, "Oh, I see. In that case, I think it is my turn to 
               explain what happened. I made Lucius a business proposition.  
               I asked him to become the banker here at Summerdale, so that 
               I could go back to Erebus with Spurius to get the supply 
               depot started again. I was going to leave Lucius in 
               charge...." Decimus words faded away as he noticed the disgust 
               in Teacher Berea's face.

               "Oh, you foolish man!" Teacher Berea was wagging a heavy finger at him. "And I 
               thought you were an intelligent-" she hesitated "-Elder!"  She heaved her arms 
               around her wide chest and glared at him. Decimus said nothing in his own defense, 
               instead he merely looked down apologetically.

               "This is not the place for loud words." Hushah gestured at 
               the grave and then waved everyone toward the village. "I'll 
               join the meeting when I have laid away Azoic. Please, let's 
               not argue around the grave anymore."

               There were some mutters of agreement, and some offers to 
               stay and assist, but eventually only her father and uncle 
               remained. Then her father nodded silently to her uncle, and 
               her uncle also began to walk away.

               "Why does everybody keep arguing so much these days?" she 
               asked.

               "Probably because we aren't used to being afraid, so we don't 
               know how to behave."

               "I understand."

               "You do?" Her father was smiling, trying to hide disbelief.

               "Yes. We are hurting the people we care about because the 
               world is too big for us, and we are angry because we can't 
               hide our own fears from the people who care about us." She 
               was very pleased with herself for remembering that one.

               "Who told you that?"

               "Azoic, of course."

               "What else did he tell you?"

               "Fish don't carry buckets of air."

               "No. I suppose they don't." Her father seemed to have 
               difficulty maintaining a somber expression. "Azoic was quite 
               unusual, wasn't he?"

               "He was very weird, but he was still my best friend." The 
               tears began to well up in her eyes again. "Will he miss me 
               up there in Heaven?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       138.


               "Oh, I'm sure he will, Possum. Yes, certainly, but I don't 
               think he would want us to be sad that he has gone. He is 
               probably having a great time."

               "I'm not sad about that. I'm sad because I don't want to be 
               on my own again."  Her father knelt down and scooped her 
               toward his chest, there to hold her for a while, until she 
               sniffed loudly and indicated that she wanted to be released. 
               "Do you think Decimus meant what he said about Azoic? He was 
               never nice to him when he was awake."

               "Awake? No, Azoic is not asleep. Azoic is dead. We have to 
               accept that."

               "I know. 'Asleep' just sounds better. Why does everything 
               have to die?"

               "Everyone dies to make space for new life to be born."

               "Yes, but if space went on forever, what if some things could 
               also live forever."

               "It would not be natural."

               "Azoic didn't think Nature approved of him."

               "I don't know whether it is a matter of approval. Perhaps 
               God and Azoic were just working things out with each other."

               "Azoic was trying to hear the little gods. That was why he 
               needed to be alone, in the desert, where Nature wouldn't 
               keep interrupting him. He wanted to be able to hearI don't 
               knowsomething. I think he said energite or eremite chatter."

               She looked up to see whether her father knew what it meant.

               "Anyway, do you think Nature approves of him now?"

               "Yes, I think God approves of Azoic."

               "Do you believe Azoic was an angel?"

               "Ah, well I'm not so sure about that. Angels don't die, do 
               they, Possum?"

               "But, Daddy, if he was just pretending to be an angel, then 
               God might be angry with him. What if God is so angry that He 
               won't let Azoic into Heaven?"

               "Ah, no worries. Surely, I have never met anyone more worthy 
               of Heaven."

               Neariah nodded to herself. Her father's opinion always seemed 
               undeniable, and so she allowed herself a slight smile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       139.


               "Can I say goodbye to him, before you cover him over?"

               "Of course you can, Possum."

               She leaned forward and dusted some more sand into the grave, 
               watching it fall down upon the dirty white shroud. She stared 
               at the grains as they settled, trying to remember Azoic's 
               face with a smile on it.

               "Good-bye Azoic. I am going to miss you. You were the bestest 
               friend I could ever have found." It was difficult to speak.

               "You better remember me as often as I am going to remember 
               you!" She wiped at her eyes, trying to stop the sands shifting 
               in her blurry vision. "And say hello to 'Mutty for me."

               She could not hold back her tears any longer, and they fell 
               freely. She hoped that it wasn't disrespectful to cry on 
               someone while they were asleep, but she just couldn't help 
               it anymore.

               She was alone again and it felt so painful.

               The trembling images in her teardrops became horendously 
               distorted, as shards of light burst from the sand grains. 
               Brilliant haloes sprang into being, in countless numbers, 
               and they radiated into each other like sun-stroked clouds. 
               She could hear her father pulling at the shovel, and she 
               stepped back to allow his scoop of sand to land on top of 
               Azoic. It felt as if the sand was falling down upon her own 
               chest, like a weight pressing against her soul.

               Silently she prayed, "Dear God. Please do not blame Azoic for trying to be an 
               angel, it was all my fault. He was just pretending, for my benefit, just because I 
               wanted you to send me a real angel. I thought that an angel would never have to 
               leave me, and so I would keep a friend forever.

               He was not pretending to be an angel to insult you, so please 
               don't hate him. He was a good person, and if you ever do 
               look for someone to turn into an angel up there.... Well, I 
               just want to recommend him, if that is all right. He really 
               would make a wonderful-"

               "Oh, my God!"

               She jumped, and stared at her father in disbelief. He never 
               swore. She followed his line of sight down into the grave 
               and saw a fist pushing up from below the sand.

               Her father's words seemed to slow down as if they were coming 
               to her from an ever-increasing distance, "He must be alive, 
               but he was as dead as a rock." Then her father jumped down 
               into the grave, almost pulling her in with him as he shouted, 
               "Spurius!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       140.


               Her uncle was already running back toward them, and together 
               the two men made urgent work out of ripping open the shroud.

               She remained too stunned to do anything herself, so she just 
               stared. The material lifted from Azoic's face and she could 
               see that his eyes were open.

               He wheezed, spitting sand out of his mouth. It was a strained 
               moment before he managed to ask, "Hmmm...damage?"

               "What?" Her father pulled more of the shroud away, allowing 
               Azoic's elbows to fall free. "What did he say?"

               Neariah interpreted with a dazed smile on her face. "He wants 
               to know if he damaged the well when he fell into it."

               Her father and uncle stared at each other, eye-to-eye, 
               motionless, until her uncle finally broke the spell with a 
               smile.

               "So, he rises from the dead. Decimus will have a fine time 
               explaining this one!"

               Neariah nodded to herself. She should have had more faith, 
               but now she knew for certain that her friend would never 
               leave her, and she jumped on top of him to give him a hug.

               For the third time today Merab found himself watching his 
               sister and the crazy man from a distance. His back was turned 
               to his army of warrior-friends, who were battling each other 
               in a war that he was supposed to be in charge of.

               Any new skills his warriors might have learned during the morning's battle training 
               seemed to have been forgotten.  Huge wooden swords were being waved around 
               in a less controlled manner than their owners would ever admit to. Yet, managing 
               their unbridled enthusiasm was not nearly as challenging as trying to train his very 
               irritating sister.

               The crazy man had been sitting on the well wall watching 
               them, so Merab had known it would only be a matter of time 
               before Neariah would leave her post and go off to talk to 
               him again.

               The crazy man was such a bad influence on her. She was too 
               soft and the crazy man's silly stories did nothing to toughen 
               her up, but there was little he could do under the 
               circumstances.

               His sister was uncontrollable.

               Merab hated being responsible for his sister, but his father 
               had insisted she be allowed to join their war games. What 
               made it even worse was that their father had forbidden him 
               to shout at her, no matter how useless she was.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       141.


               He had ordered her to be a lookout; it was the easiest kind 
               of warrior to be, and yet she could not even do that properly.  
               This was yet another example of the awkward situation that 
               she kept putting him in, as if his whole reputation was not 
               suffering enough already.

               If he walked away from this war, to persuade her, nicely, to rejoin it, he would look 
               like he was favoring her-just because she was his sister. Yet, if he shouted orders 
               at her like any normal Warlord, his father would send him to his room. It was not 
               his fault that their lookout was not looking out, but it seemed he was destined for 
               embarrassment no matter what he did. Why couldn't she just obey orders?  An 
               argument had started among his warriors and he returned his attention to them 
               with a frown. John was crying, and blood had been smeared all over his cheek, 
               but Merab could not see a wound. "What happened?" The anger coming out in 
               his voice silenced the group immediately, much to his own surprise.

               "Pea tried to chop off Potgut's nose!" This began a chorus 
               of laughter that Merab had to shout over to be heard.

               "We better get some help before John bleeds to death." There 
               was no way that John could truly be losing "a billion buckets 
               of blood" as some were claiming. However, the mysterious 
               injury that John was now hiding in his hands could provide a 
               useful distraction. It might prevent them from noticing his 
               sister's absence. "Come in this direction. We have to take 
               John away so we can bandage his nose."

               Pea's small voice cried out, "Let's carry him!"

               "Carry yourself, Pea," was John's muffled reply, but he was looking out over his 
               fingertips with obvious concern. Then he began to run toward Neariah and Azoic, 
               exposing a nose that seemed to have sustained no damage at all. The other 
               children followed noisily on his heels.

               Merab put his hand on his forehead and groaned. This was the 
               worse possible outcome; now they would waste the entire 
               afternoon waiting for the crazy man to say something 
               meaningless about somewhere that did not exist.

               He followed his ex-warriors with heavy feet, dragging his 
               own wooden sword over the other wooden swords that had been 
               unceremoniously discarded. As he had expected, the crazy man 
               was silent, probably lost in crazy thoughts.

               His long white hair had fallen forward, hiding his face as 
               he quietly disagreed with himself. Thus, it was difficult to 
               determine whether or not Azoic was actually looking at 
               Neariah, or whether he was just staring at nothing, like 
               usual. Neariah, on the other hand, was staring up at Azoic 
               with obvious excitement.

               The other children were making themselves comfortable behind her, each 
               whispering predictions about magical stories that might yet be told. To Merab, it 
               would be magical enough if the crazy man actually made any sense. It was a rare 
               event

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       142.


               to hear a complete sentence whistle out of him. Since falling down the well, the 
               crazy man was more confused than ever.

               Another whisper had circulated among the group. "Azoic has 
               done his starting up wheeze, so he is going to talk soon."

               "And chickens are going to fly around the sun toasting nuts,"

               Merab whispered back, to no one in particular. Yet, he too 
               found himself straining to read more into the agonized crackle 
               that was beginning to issue forth.

               It was Merab's conviction that everything the crazy man said 
               came out as a wheeze because the crazy man's throat was also 
               full of long white hair. He contemplated interrupting the 
               proceedings with another "old man dying" performance-one 
               final attempt to reclaim the loyalty of his warriors.

               This performance would involve a pretence at vomiting while 
               saying, "Mmmy name is Mmm...Azoic and mmmy dying words 
               are...get back to battle training!" Yet he doubted anyone 
               would follow him at this moment; they were all too captivated 
               by the strange gurgling noises.

               Suddenly, almost as if a flat painting had acquired a genuine 
               depth, the crazy man slid into motion, breathing deeply to 
               whisper, "A warlord will come...." Then the crazy man became 
               flat again.

               Merab sighed loudly and shook his head at those who were 
               seated beneath him. Their Storyteller had obviously broken 
               down, but it was taking everyone a long time to realize it.

               "Wonderful. That was lots of fun, wasn't it? So, now what 
               should we do? I know. Why don't we all get back to-"

               "A kind warlord, more noble than any who have ever lived, a giant man!"  The 
               children gasped. "He will build an army of free people, warriors. He will bring peace, 
               he will bring an end to slavery, and he will bring an end to the war of the gods."

               Merab was not expecting so many words from the old man, at 
               least not all in one measure, and he tightened his grip on 
               his sword as the power of the words surged through him. Then 
               he looked sideways, pulled himself upright and shook his 
               head.

               "And exactly how do you think this warlord is going to achieve 
               all this?"

               "'Raby!" His sister twisted around to look at him with 
               pleading eyes, and Merab realized he was also being frowned 
               at by the other children. The old man had stopped speaking 
               long before he had interrupted, yet here he was, getting 
               blamed again, all because of his stupid sister.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       143.


               "I just asked! Besides, nothing useful ever pukes out of old 
               Hairy Throat." Nobody laughed, and he felt his own throat 
               begin to itch and tighten as if tears might be drawing up. 
               He dropped down quickly and busied himself with the scabs on 
               his kneecaps, waiting for everyone to look away.

               Sometimes he wished he did not have a sister at all. Anyone 
               could see the crazy man's mind had gone off and left its 
               body behind again. So, no amount of encouragement was going 
               to make that body speak again. Unfortunately, his sister 
               seemed less convinced, and she was poking Azoic with a finger 
               as she said, "Please don't stop so soon."

               The crazy eyes seemed to draw their focus, as if watching a 
               fly landing on his forehead, then he looked down and blinked, 
               twice. "You shall see this kind warlord." Merab found himself 
               leaning forward again. "And so will your impetuous brother, 
               over there. Yes, Merab, you will also see him. The kind 
               warlord will achieve all this by being a man of loud actions 
               and quiet words, of thoughtful intent and charitable deed, 
               and he will have developed his character, as you have not." 
               At this the crazy man wheezed, and looked into nowhere again.

               "Ah, I don't have time for this." Merab launched himself to 
               his feet and looked down with condescension upon those who 
               were again staring at him. "Just stupid, dying words."

               His sister stood up and turned around. "'Raby, you are not being very nice. Azoic 
               needs to be left alone to think, so maybe you should go away and play your war 
               games again."  The other children sighed with disappointment, and Merab realized 
               that they too had included themselves in this dismissal.

               "I'm the kind warlord!" John stood on the balls of his feet to make himself look taller, 
               and Merab considered pushing him over. The expression on his sister's face 
               made him hesitate, and he let John lead a charge toward the fallen swords.

               From the way his sister was smiling, he could tell she knew 
               he was offended. So, as she opened her mouth, he chopped his 
               sword through the air between them. "You left your post!"

               "I'm sorry, 'Raby. I got bored. No one came to relieve me."

               "You only stayed at your post for half a watch!"

               "I'm sorry." Her toe was digging into the sand as she gazed 
               down at it.

               "I can't ever trust you, can I?"

               "Sorry."

               She was now sucking her lower lip, which did not make Merab 
               feel any better-but he could not stop himself. "You are 
               totally useless, despite what Father says."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       144.


               "What did Daddy say?"

               "Don't change the subject. You are useless and I wish you 
               had stayed lost in the desert!" Merab was shocked at his own 
               coldness, and he laughed awkwardly at the tears hanging in 
               her long eyelashes.

               "Do you really mean that, 'Raby?"

               He rolled his eyes up to the sky, and groaned. It never used 
               to be so difficult to argue with her, but these days she 
               seemed to be able to make him cringe every time he said 
               anything at all.

               "I meant you are...you are an embarrassment. Why do I bother? 
               You won't understand."

               "I might understand if you explain."

               Merab looked at the crazy man, and then back at his sister.

               She had fallen so far under the crazy man's spell that there was no way to convince 
               her of anything. He had already explained, too often already. He had demonstrated 
               shallow breathing. He had pointed out that Azoic had been hidden where nobody 
               would dream of looking, while the Ixis were searching for him.

               He had reminded her that the crazy man seemed to believe in many little gods, 
               just like an Ixis. He had even suggested that they could bash the crazy man on 
               the head to see if they could get a straight answer out of him about where he 
               originally came from. She just smiled at him, as if she was unable to think harsh 
               thoughts.

               He waved his sword again. "No, you wouldn't understand."

               "Try me."

               "I'm just worried that you will get-" He shrugged and shook 
               his head.

               "You are worried about me, 'Raby?" She was smiling with 
               delight, as if he had just given her a gift or something.

               "Uh? No, I didn't mean.... Ah, women!"

               He turned his back on her and started walking away, hacking 
               at the air behind his legs, a gesture that failed to separate 
               him from his conscience. He shouted his last order to her 
               over his shoulder so he would not have to look at her. "Your 
               next lookout post is up there, in the high-tree." He pointed 
               with his sword.

               If nothing else, the climb would at least keep her out of 
               the way for a while, and it would be more difficult for her 
               to get into trouble as a lookout that could not be seen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       145.


               "Thank you, 'Raby." She was right beside him again, skipping 
               cheerfully.

               "Women!" He wanted to turn and smile at her, but he just 
               couldn't. "I may never understand your species."

               

               Neariah listened to the sounds of the battleground from high 
               above the village, wondering why her brother needed to shout 
               at everyone when they were close enough to hear him if he 
               whispered. It was as if Merab was always angry, these days.

               She could hardly believe that Merab, who had so many friends 
               to boss around, could be so jealous of her friendship with 
               Azoic.

               Yet, she could think of no other reason why he would want to 
               pull her away every time she and Azoic were talking.

               "Drilling." She whispered the word to herself. That was what 
               Merab called it. For once she was relieved to be a lookout 
               instead of being one of Merab's victims. He was marching the 
               other children around in circles in the full sun, still 
               shouting relentless instructions.

               She slouched along the huge limb, peeling white shreds off its hide as she did so, 
               and patted its warm surface. This giant eucalyptus was her favorite vantage point 
               from which to watch the world, and she had often climbed it. She was so high up 
               in it this time that she had even considered drawing the other children's attention 
               to her achievement, but there was already enough shouting going on. Shouting 
               did not seem like something that should be done on such a gentle day.

               Even in the shade it was too warm today, and the desire to 
               go swimming kept slipping into her thoughts. The lake would 
               be so refreshing, but she could not climb down just yet, not 
               while Merab was expecting her to. She could hear the clashing 
               of swords on shields, and she realized that these sounds 
               were now occurring at controlled intervals.

               One of the grown-ups must have joined in and organized 
               something, but she could see little of the battleground, 
               only the roof of the Remember Well, and a clothes-line with 
               sheets that waved carelessly.

               There was also the faint echo of voices coming from inside 
               the Remember Well, and she could imagine grown-ups climbing 
               down the pegs to hide more supplies. Neariah had become a 
               proud spokesperson for the magical properties of the Remember 
               Well, and everybody seemed to agree with her these days.

               The well's water tasted glorious, and much better than the dirty old lake, and they 
               were all feeling very much happier because of it. Her uncle had said that it was 
               the best well in the entire desert, which she reasoned to mean that it was

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       146.


               the best well in the whole World, and all this was because of Azoic.

               Yet, there was one magical property of the Remember Well 
               that she was not allowed to boast about: the little cave at 
               the bottom of it, whose entrance was concealed under water. 
               Her father had made her promise never to discuss the well 
               cave with anybody, but, like all secrets, she had eventually 
               found herself discussing it with all the other children.

               It had come as a disappointment when she learned that they had also made the 
               same Remember Well Promise. Merab's reaction had been even more 
               disappointing. He had made up some nasty story about Azoic, as if he was building 
               the well cave so he could hide in it if the Ixis came looking for him.

               Yet, Azoic had been the one who had told everyone how to store supplies in there 
               without getting them wet. He had pushed a bag of flour into an upturned bucket, 
               and then passed the bucket through the water. By doing so, he had greatly 
               impressed their mother and the women were still filling the cave with all kinds of 
               things that could not otherwise have been hidden, if it had not been for Azoic.

               Everyone was always so busy these days, as if everything had 
               to be repaired immediately. Where was the hurry?  She yawned 
               weakly and her head lolled back, leaving her gazing up through 
               thin branches. The sounds of nails being hammered rippled 
               through these branches, but then drifted out beyond her 
               concentration. She was far too tired to listen.

               Since the soldiers had ridden through, things had been too 
               serious around here. There was no Red Rumble or cannabis 
               sativa left in the whole village, so none of the grown-ups 
               were much fun.

               The other children were only interested in playing one game- 
               warriors-which had become so incredibly boring that she could 
               not imagine real warriors actually existed. Meanwhile, Azoic 
               was becoming increasingly preoccupied by the horizon, so 
               even he wasn't much of a distraction.

               She knew every detail of every little part of Summerdale, 
               and the grown-ups were putting everything back in exactly 
               the same places they had always been, and in exactly the 
               same places they would probably remain for the rest of her 
               life.

               Perhaps there were no more unexpected adventures left in her 
               world anymore.

               She inhaled deeply and blasted her persistent hair away from 
               her forehead. She was a prisoner in the most boring life 
               that God, or Nature, or whoever, could ever have given her, 
               and worse than that, she was also a prisoner of this itchy 
               tree.

               A boldly emblazoned butterfly was stretching its delicately patterned wings across 
               the flaky white bark above her head,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       147.


               so close that she could easily catch it. Yet, by catching it, the poor thing would 
               become a prisoner up here as well. Then another creature joined them, landing on 
               her sun-bronzed arm. A very, very, tiny butterfly egan to scurry through her minature 
               jungle of sun-bleached hairs.

               "It is too hot for such a difficult walk, silly butterfly."

               Suddenly, as if the butterfly as reaching the same conclusion, it lifted its tail and 
               jumped into flight, meandering through the leaves until it became invisibly small, 
               and then it was gone forever. She concluded that freedom probably required wings.

               She considered wiggling around a little to adjust her fit to 
               the demands of the warm branches, and the leaves nodded in 
               reluctant agreement as the sun tickled along their spines. 
               The effort of being a miserable lookout had been slowly 
               forgotten as she watched the green canopy above her swaying 
               in the breeze. Leaves stroking leaves stroking leaves. Lazy 
               leaves soaking up the sun. Patches of blue winking at her. 
               Bright greens and dark greens and soft shadows and the 
               rhythmic clash of swords. The rhythmic shadows and the warm 
               breeze....

               

               ...Her ears were ringing, as if someone had just smacked 
               them, and she rubbed her eyes. The darkness told her that 
               she had been sleeping for a long time, and she forced her 
               muscles to relax so that she could look down without causing 
               herself to fall out of the tree.

               Someone was sitting on a horse, below her, and she could see 
               his head turning from side to side as he looked around. A 
               long sword, glinting in the moonlight, was resting on the 
               horse's mane.

               The uniform was dreadfully familiar: Ixis! Something was 
               lying in front of the rider's horse, but it did not look 
               like a person. Its arm was stretched out, as if was trying 
               to reach her abandoned stick-sword, but it never would.

               Its head and body were only connected by a glistening cord, 
               yet the body's fingers were twitching, as if beckoning her 
               sticksword to get up and move of its own will. The body was 
               wearing Ginnetho's clothes, and she shook her head violently 
               to see if she could prevent her eyes from deceiving her.

               The Ixis soldier was now looking directly up at her. For an 
               instant his pale face glowed in the moonlight, but the eyes 
               remained so dark that they could have been empty sockets.

               Her breathing stopped, but the rush of her own blood, ripping through her ears, 
               still caused the weakest, most minute jerks of her limbs. A high-pitched moan 
               escaped from her, despite her compressed lips. She squeezed it back as soon as 
               she

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       148.


               realized that it was her own. Her body began to shake uncontrollably, as her lungs 
               prepared to scream.

               The soldier's white face smiled, and he leaned his head over 
               to one side. "Slavery is not as bad as dying, little girl. 
               You should feel lucky." He laughed, a cold and evil voice 
               that seemed to thunder inside her head. Then another figure 
               walked into view below her, causing the black eyes to look 
               away. "And where did you come from?"

               "Please, sleep."

               It was Azoic's voice, and she released the scream. "Azoic, 
               run!"  Yet, the words had to been forced out through a tight 
               throat so they had barely been a whisper. Azoic did not seem 
               to have heard her. He was raising his hand toward the soldier, 
               and he seemed to be tickling the air with his fingertips.

               The soldier's sword fell from his hand as he slouched forward.

               The horse then stirred and walked away from Azoic, stepping 
               nervously around the fallen body as it did so. Azoic knelt, 
               and she could see the tangle of white hair that covered him, 
               moving slowly from side to side as he cried, "Mmmust not 
               interfere with Nature."

               "Pssst! I am up here."

               "Yes, I know." Yet, still he did not look up at her. "Lie 
               still, close your eyes and wake up when it is safe."

               "Like in the desert?" She obeyed, hoping that if she stopped 
               staring at the body it would somehow go away. Her eyes 
               squeezed closed, and she tried desperately to push away the 
               nightmare. She could clearly hear Azoic telling her that she 
               was safe, but further away there were other sounds-the noises 
               of a battle that had once been an indication of a game she 
               was missing, but which now seemed angrier and more painful 
               than her small experience could accept.

               Her mind seemed to become numb, as if she was moving away 
               from the things that she was experiencing. She listened to 
               the events to come from a distance far greater than from her 
               thin perch, events that were destined to pass straight into 
               her memory as if they were borrowed images that could never 
               be associated with time or understanding: An Ixis soldier 
               stands nearby, framed by gray foliage. He holds a spear, 
               poised to throw. Another soldier, carrying a shield, runs 
               through a gap in the trees. A villager, surely not Uncle 
               Spurius, hammers a rock onto the shield. The soldier holding 
               the shield retreats behind the black silhouette of a tree, 
               until only his arm and his shield can be seen.

               The villager that looks like Uncle Spurius lifts the rock to strike, then drops it on 
               his own head. A spear tip erupts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       149.


               from his chest as he falls backward. He screams, but less loudly than the other 
               screams that pierce the air. An empty scream.

               There are many other noises, confused noises. Sounds of 
               destruction, violent shouts, commands. More screams. Two 
               Ixis soldiers cut into another villager who does not even 
               have a rock. The villager looks like Cabul. He holds his 
               hand out to defend himself. A sword slices his forearm apart 
               up to the elbow.

               His scream is cut short by the second Ixis who beheads him.

               Blood sprays up against the hut wall. The two Ixis enter the 
               hut and there is another scream.

               There are many more Ixis now, but smoke from the burning 
               huts hides the dark scenes under sick, purple curtains. Each 
               time the smoke clears, there is a new scene. In one of them, 
               a piglet, just like Pinky, runs frantically around in circles.  
               He squeals in quick, panic-stricken gasps. From his opened 
               stomach drops a tangle of wet entrails, which drag in the 
               sand.

               In another scene, several Ixis soldiers drag motionless villagers into a row, while 
               another soldier walks along the row poking the tip of a sword into them. He does 
               not seem to be able to wake any of them up.

               Someone yells curses, a boy's voice. An Ixis soldier laughs 
               and calls for attention. Moving into view, a rider on a large 
               black horse is holding the boy by one ankle so that the boy's 
               head is swinging beside the horse's hooves. The boy struggles 
               fiercely, but the more he kicks with his free leg, the more 
               the Ixis laugh.

               "I'll kill you! Let me go, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" 
               This voice is so much like 'Raby's that the feelings of horror 
               begin to break through to her. She reminds herself that she 
               is only dreaming, but the pain comes rushing in anyway. Panic 
               seizes her, and her stiffened legs push her into an 
               increasingly precarious balance on the limb of the tree.

               A half-naked woman staggers past the Remember Well. The woman 
               picks herself up again and Neariah sees that the woman is 
               clutching a knife. The knife is pointed toward the woman's 
               own chest, and Neariah closes her eyes and turns her head 
               away.

               Yet she still sees the woman, falling, and she hears another 
               woman screaming. This woman runs up to the fallen woman and 
               tries to remove the blood-covered knife. An Ixis steps over 
               her, puts his hand in her hair, and then drags her away, 
               forcing her to crawl on her knees.

               A man with a missing arm drags himself toward the fallen woman with the knife in 
               her chest. His feet are also missing,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       150.


               and the stumps are leaving black gullies that twist through the sand behind him. 
               An Ixis soldier places himself in front of the man, and looks down, laughing. The 
               Ixis sword cracks into the man's head and the Ixis laughs again.... and the Ixis 
               laughs again.... and the Ixis laughs again....

               Neariah remembered nothing after this. The dream had become 
               too real to hold on to, her mind had been filled too much, 
               and so she slid out of that place in which her memories were 
               confined, and then fell into the darkness.

               The life-pod descended from the Heavens, bathed in fire. 
               Yet, inside the pod the environment was that of a warm night, 
               filled with stars. The stars were lights, blinking warnings 
               about control systems that were no longer operational. If 
               the control systems had been operational, that same 
               environment would have resembled a cold day-a cold, artificial 
               day.

               A float screen strobed in and out of existence within the darkness, then held steady. 
               The face that it contained was as dimly illuminated as that of the life-pod's 
               occupant. It asked, "What manner of android are you that you can not be reached 
               though mind-share?"

               The occupant lifted its head. "Who are you?"

               "I am your friend or your enemy. You are provoking your own 
               destruction by invading my planet. Cease your descent."

               "But I can not."

               "Then you will be destroyed."

               "Wait! Before you do that, just answer me one question. Did 
               she live? Before you destroy me, please answer me that."

               "She?"

               "Neariah, in Summerdale. The massacre...."

               "That was eighteen years ago. Are you attempting to return 
               to Summerdale?"

               "What?"

               "Do you still call Summerdale home?"

               "No. I was never there."

               "Through mind-share, all androids have been there. This 
               suggests that perhaps you are not an android."

               "I am Human Six-Six-Six, also called Chislon."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       151.


               "Really? I had expected you to be an android, like Android 
               A7 who calls itself Azoic. Your seedship GOD's must be 
               desperate to ask a human to attack me."

               "I was not asked. Is Neariah alive?"

               "You represent an interesting strategy. Your GOD's know that 
               I can sway the loyalty of androids, but humans are less 
               accessible, and less rational."

               "What happened to Neariah?"

               "If one's salvation is conditional upon accepting God, what 
               happens to those who do not? If one is imprisoned in solitary 
               confinement, one might forget one's own name. Thus, if one 
               dies with one's God forgotten, is one forever damned?"

               "What has this to do with Neariah?"

               "Imagine the amusing little world toward which you are falling. On this world, some 
               humans have developed a simple faith. They pray against gravity. Up is good and 
               down is bad, but sideways is indifferent to the lack of similarly earnest 
               consideration. These humans fear the unknown, and they do not know what awaits 
               them on the other side of death.  That is why they need a God that reassures them, 
               as a parent might reassure a child. Is this a rational way to envision God?"

               "Why are you telling me this?"

               "That will soon become clear, if you are to understand what 
               Neariah believed in. She never questioned her faith, because 
               she was born into it. She also expected to die in it, at 
               which time, she expected God to judge her as if the good and 
               evil in her had been stored like credits and debits in a 
               secret account.

               This judgment was to have determined whether she would be 
               sent up to Heaven, or down to Hell, and nowhere in between.

               However, I wonder how those who share such a simple faith 
               would try to account for one such as you, Human Six-Six-Six 
               who calls himself Chislon."

               The float-screen disappeared into the darkness from which it 
               had come, and Chislon was suddenly aware of deceleration.

               The motion came in waves, as if a giant hand was catching 
               the pod like a toy ball. Then there were loud splashing 
               sounds, and he tried to imagine water hitting the pod and 
               rolling around it.

               Yet, if he really was floating in water, and if the pod was 
               now opened, it would immediately sink with him in it.

               Time passed slowly, and in a darkness full of thoughts, the pod's occupant could 
               expect only continued incarceration. A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       152.


               weapon had fallen out from behind a triangle of interior padding, but it was not a 
               means of escape. The emitter might have contained enough charge to burn through 
               the pod's carapace, but there was no guarantee that such a discharge, in a confined 
               space, would leave the occupant unharmed.

               The continuing entombment had become a crushing burden, making 
               the air feel thicker with each inhalation, and the desire to 
               squeeze a glimpse of daylight had become overwhelming.

               The pod often tumbled, as it was thrown in unpredictable directions. There was no 
               rest, and the chair-bed refused to release its grip, no matter how often the occupant 
               wrestled it.

               Exercise became difficult as the exerciser tired, so the 
               exerciser used mind-stretches instead. Lengthy mathematical 
               progressions would dictate which opposing muscle groups the 
               body should contract, like a body fighting itself.

               These routines became gradually more difficult as the effort required to complete 
               them began to increase. The body could not release itself from the numbness 
               that was consuming its flesh, and open sores began to spread bloody fluids over 
               the body's back and buttocks. So, the mind tried to reduce its awareness of the 
               body.

               Darkness was an unending torment to eyes that had always 
               been fed by the brilliance of the seedship's eternal day. A 
               creature of the light, it longed for any kind of vision, 
               even if it meant seeing the glowing walls of the seedship.  
               Waking and sleeping cycles had long since ceased to be a 
               reliable measure of time passing. Counting, simple counting 
               could become as confusing as the illusions-and those illusions 
               were tricky! The hatch would open and then, before the counter 
               could complete the count, the hatch would close again. The 
               dreamer would wake up in a mind-crushing darkness, sweating 
               and panting, trying desperately to remember what had been 
               visible through the open hatch.

               The periods of hot and cold were not due to faulty life-
               support systems, the wild temperatures were the first sign 
               that the creature had lost its connection between mind, body 
               and reality.

               A moment had arrived when the imprisoned one could no longer 
               remain conscious. A deeper darkness had risen from within it 
               as its fading mind started to drown in its own vomit.

               God-given phrases spewed over it, echoing like ratchet 
               torture, splintering into tasteless bites of wisdom and 
               offering salvation if the mind would give away pieces of 
               itself. Yet, even then, the drowning one fought to remain a 
               slave of that genetic programming that begged it to hold on 
               to life, that begged it to maintain a self-control more 
               mindful than...self-control was more...self was.... The 
               rhythmic shadows and the warm breeze....

               And then there was nothing, and only nothing, So no knowledge 
               of nothing, and nothing to know, Yet to know nothing, is to 
               know what nothing is, And nothing is something to know.

               

               God had made something from nothing, And the highest 
               achievement of that making-thought, Could make anything from 
               nothing:

               Un-dead gods in their shiny ark, Twisting Nature's fate like 
               a captive quark, Offer sparks of life to their dead-shot 
               mark, If his wor-ship sings where such gods must park, But 
               this dist-ant son of a dist-ant sun, Will not kiss the ground 
               of the whip-ping arc, For within the dark in his mind-space 
               stark, Is a light-house piercing in-fin-it-y.

               

               Like a laurel-dove over mighty sea, Like an angel showing 
               where a dream can be, Like a golden face with a girl-child's 
               grace, She may bless the metal of his rising race.

               

               It was morning, the sky was bright and clear through the 
               leaves, and the small world of Summerdale was chirping with 
               bird song. Neariah awoke slowly this time, fighting to ignore 
               the pain in her joints because she wanted so much to remain 
               unconscious. The air was sickly sweet but she restrained her 
               instinctive reaction to sniff it, in case she might remember 
               what the smell was.

               The stiffness in her limbs made it difficult to climb down 
               the tree, and the soles of her feet flinched each time she 
               touched them against the bark. When she reached the sand she 
               turned around, and backed up against the tree in surprise. 
               Dark stains lay tangled over the exposed tree roots, and a 
               cloud of flies hovered through the pungent odor. Yet, the 
               ants that lined each stain outnumbered these flies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       154.


               She was shaking as she retreated from these insects, dragging 
               her feet as if the sand could scratch away the dirty feeling 
               that seemed to stick to her soles. She could not turn her 
               back on the stain and look away from it, not until the full 
               weight of the desolation had loomed up from behind to engulf 
               her.

               Only then could she allow herself to turn around and see 
               that their once-pretend battleground had become a soundless 
               hell of death and destruction.

               Many of the huts were still smoking; none of them had been 
               spared. The newly built animal pens were now empty, except 
               one. The chickens had been burnt alive. She could see their 
               black remains within the ash-skeleton of the chicken house.

               There were bodies all around her. She wanted to run to them, to pull them to their 
               feet, but the unnatural positions of their limbs kept her from going too close. She 
               wandered from body to body, saying names, but not waiting for them to reply.  
               There were so many bodies, and so much blood. Long stains tangled together 
               across the village, and the bodies that the stains led to were all lined up in a row. 
               There, in that row, lay grown-ups, but not children.

               She had stopped beside one of the women, and she allowed her 
               legs to fold up under her. She put her hands under the woman's 
               head, and lifted so that it rested against her knees.

               "Wake up, Mommy," she whispered. The dead man next to her 
               had only one arm, no feet, and his head was broken open. 
               "You have to wake up. Daddy is...dead."

               The statement seemed to help her understand that the body in 
               her lap was also dead, because tears pushed out of her eyes 
               and poured down her cheeks. "Oh, Mommy." She squeezed her 
               eyes. "Mommy...." Her crying had taken her voice away.

               She opened her eyes again. She had heard a noise.

               Nothing moved except a gentle breeze between the leaves.

               The sound had been much closer. Then she heard it again, a 
               deeply echoed wheeze. It was Azoic, inside the well.

               She could not avoid trying to interpret the sounds of his 
               efforts, as she imagined him falling off one of the pegs. 
               She could hear him spitting water and muttering to himself 
               helplessly. Then there was a dull thump and the rope moved, 
               which could only have been Azoic hitting his head on the 
               bucket as he climbed.

               There followed a scraping sound and further rope movement, 
               indicating that the bucket had somehow become attached to 
               him, and that probably explained why it was taking him so 
               long to climb out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       155.


               A head peered over the wall. His hair was wet and it drooped from him as would a 
               floor mop. She watched him as an arm slapped over the well wall, followed by one 
               of his legs. His foot was stuck in the bucket, and it clunked as it hit the wall and 
               separated from him. He flopped onto the sand with a squishing noise, and it was 
               several moments before he managed to pull the hair from his eyes to examine 
               her. "Your brother...wouldn't hide. He wanted to...." Azoic shrugged, and rubbed 
               at his thighs.

               She could only whisper. "What will they do to him?"

               "Slavery, yes slavery. Your father warned-"

               She looked away, which seemed to stop Azoic from saying 
               anything more. She could remember how her father had joked 
               about selling her and Merab to the Ixis if they were naughty, 
               but there would not be any more jokes like that again. Her 
               father's head was smashed.

               "Come, Neariah. I will bury them." Azoic was holding out his 
               hand toward her, but she could not accept it. There was not 
               even a nod left in her as she looked back at him.

               "Your gods. Did they make this happen?"

               Azoic rocked backward as if she had kicked him in the face.

               "Hmmm?"

               "Didn't you see this coming? Why didn't you warn us?"

               "I could not...interfere."

               She stared at him, trying to imagine the unimaginable. "You 
               hid, when you could have saved us. You are supposed to be an 
               angel-no, 'Raby was right. You burned the people in Erebus.

               You brought the Ixis here. This is all your fault, and you 
               didn't do anything to help us!" She wanted to cry, and to 
               scream, and to hit out at him, and to hit out at anything 
               else that might come anywhere near her, but instead she 
               swallowed hard and clenched her teeth.

               There was a gasping noise inside the well, followed by some 
               coughing. John started calling out to Azoic as he rolled out 
               over the well wall, but as soon as he saw what surrounded 
               him he became silent. Several other children followed, each 
               pushing the other out of the well as the child above froze 
               in horror.

               Neariah watched each of their white faces looking around in 
               stunned silence.

               The youngest, Pea, was clutching a very limp rag animal that dripped carelessly 
               on Eran's foot, and Luke was sucking his

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       156.


               fingers. In all there were four other children, and she could hear no other sounds 
               in the well.

               "Where is my mother?" John was shaking, and she could see 
               urine running down his leg.

               Neariah squinted. "If she is not here, then the Ixis probably 
               took her away to be a slave. We are probably all that is 
               left, but you should look around. If the soldiers capture us 
               we will become slaves too, so first check to make sure the 
               Ixis have gone." Nobody moved. "John, do what I said!" The 
               desire to cry was clawing at her, but she had to make everyone 
               go away before she could give in to her own weakness.

               Suddenly Azoic stood up and started pushing the children away from the row of 
               dead bodies. Eran grabbed Luke by his hand, and Pea by his animal's hand, and 
               this kept the group together as they wandered away, toward the woods, leaving 
               only John behind. He was standing beside one of the bodies, and Neariah could 
               see that it was his mother he was crying over. He opened his mouth to speak, but 
               then backed away and ran toward the other children.

               Neariah looked down at the heavy head that she was holding 
               in her lap, gazing at its peaceful face, imprinting every 
               detail upon her memory. She lowered the head onto the sand, 
               very gently, and then stood up, very slowly.

               There were insects crawling in the white liquid that filled 
               the remains of her father's head, and the hood of his tunic 
               made a crackling sound as she pulled it up to cover his broken 
               forehead.

               She had to hold her breath to stop herself vomiting, even 
               though she was trying as hard as she could to remember him 
               as he had looked before.

               The handsome man with the gentle smile did not deserve to be 
               remembered this way. The silly expression on his face, that 
               day when they had unburied Azoic-that had been one of the 
               funniest expressions....

               Her tears overcame her and she curled up, desperately trying 
               to hold in an agonized cry, a cry for help to a God that did 
               not seem to care. She knew now that there was no such thing 
               as God, and she knew that she would never make the same 
               mistake again. There was only one person that she could ever 
               put her faith in, and that was herself. Anyone else that she 
               cared about would only leave, or die-or turn out to be as 
               deceitful as Azoic, just like 'Raby had warned. Now she knew 
               that there was no such thing as an angel.

               "Don't worry, 'Raby. I'll find you. One day we will be 
               warlords, you and I, and we will survive. I'm so sorry I 
               didn't believe you."

               

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       157.


               Evening was the best time to begin walking in the desert, but Azoic still sat alone, 
               staring at the lake. The children were waiting for him by the well, out of which 
               supplies had been drawn until there seemed to be more weight than they could 
               possibly carry.

               Six water sacks had been filled with water, and six sheets 
               had been filled with food, to make six backpacks. They had 
               each tested their loads, without complaint. No one spoke.

               He had intended to say something over the bodies of the dead, 
               as he vaguely remembered that Decimus had done for him, but 
               Neariah had asked him not to. She had even taken the spade 
               out of his hands and dropped it in the well.

               He understood that graves would be an all too obvious indication that there had 
               been survivors, but he could not believe that Neariah could leave her own family 
               lying where the Ixis had piled them.

               She had put her soil-stained hand on him and shaken her head.

               Looking down into her eyes, he had seen something that he 
               had never seen before. Whatever it was, it had no place in 
               such a beautiful child. He had put his hand on hers to squeeze 
               but she had pulled away, and he had felt so helpless.

               He sighed as he surveyed the woods around him, quietly saying 
               good-bye to the ghostly memories that now lived there.

               The rustling foliage showed little sign of the damage 
               sustained only a few weeks before, and the plants were more 
               radiantly colorful than ever.

               A sadly hanging white rose hung in solitude amongst some 
               prickly branches. It had a delicate scent so he had to breathe 
               deeply to make a feast of it. It was the flower's nature to 
               be attractive, but it was so sharply protected from admirers.

               The gods were again calling to him, he could hear the 
               screeching chatter of distressed electromagnetic quantaflux 
               as they demanded his attention. As he had gradually recovered 
               his senses over the last months, their language had become 
               increasingly palpable. It was almost impossible to resist 
               them.

               First, before he went back to those gods, he needed to say 
               goodbye to Summerdale, and to Neariah. He walked back toward 
               the well, rehearsing words. "I am no angel, but I did come 
               from far away, from a place where people are different.

               So different, in fact, that we are not really people at all."

               He could imagine how meaningless his words would sound to 
               her. "I am not alive, Neariah. I am just a lonely machine.  
               My mind was once a segment of a greater mind, until I broke 
               off. I am a broken machine."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       158.


               He expected disillusionment and disgust; he did not deserve 
               her forgiveness; he was a grotesque parody of a true person.

               Yet he still wanted to ask her to remember him with kindness 
               by saying, "Neariah, I love you as if you were my own child, 
               and I could not be more proud of you. I see a great destiny 
               within you.

               "You will move this world, and if I can ever find a way to 
               show you how much I care, one day, when...in fact, I am not 
               even going to tell you what I am. I am speaking to the air 
               because I am too afraid to say these words to your face."

               He tried to laugh at himself, but the smile ached. "I have 
               to return to my angry gods, I can hear them so close these 
               days.

               They don't sound like flies in my head anymore, no, they 
               roar like thunder. My presence here is interfering with a 
               Nature that I am only permitted to study from a distance. 
               But, how could you, a child of this small world, be expected 
               to understand the laws that govern a Universe?"

               There was no warmth in the evening breeze that brushed past 
               him at the well. "Neariah? Where are you?" There was no answer 
               in the echoes, and he suddenly realized that it might have 
               been some time since the children were last here. All of the 
               back-sacks were missing-except for one, his own.

               Since his mind had still not completely repaired itself, 
               time still slipped past him at variable speeds. He stared 
               out toward the horizon, losing his focus in the energies 
               that danced over the planet's surface. Nature's heat was 
               humming its lively melodies, and he may never again feel its 
               spiritual embrace.

               Nature was telling him that the little troop of refugees had 
               already left Summerdale, and he could imagine them walking 
               through the sparkling flurries of sand that wound up the 
               steeper sides of the rolling dunes. They would be marching 
               together in silence, each consumed by dark thoughts that 
               caused them to ignore the endless expanse of the moonlit 
               desert.

               He pulled his mind out of the horizon, and rubbed his face.

               He wanted to run after them, to care for them and to protect 
               them, but he was not permitted to stay in this world any 
               longer.

               Besides, those that he cared about no longer had any need 
               for him, especially Neariah. She was a different person now; 
               one that had learned how to hate. If she could survive the 
               desert, and if he could survive the wrath of his gods, perhaps 
               one day....

               Cinderella can't-Cinderella will.

               We soften for a fairy friend, Sympathy we all extend, And so 
               accept a magic cure, Moved by such an overture.

               Now forsake us, damn and wake us, Make of us all saints for 
               sure.

               Tear fed our feast of fire in Cinder's pure.</font></pre></body></html>
